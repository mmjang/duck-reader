Delete some stuff.” Of course, you oblige, but there’s a hitch: “Other” files are taking up a <em>ton</em> of data, and your computer won’t tell you what those “Other” files are. How are you supposed to delete the files if you don’t even know what they are?<br></p><h2 id=\"h237830\"><a id=\"\"></a>What are the ‘Other’ files?</h2><p>In macOS, Other files are just that—files other than those that fit neatly into categories, like music, movies, documents, and photos.

While Apple doesn’t advertise where it keeps these files, you can get yourself there by pressing Shift+Command+G,  typing ~Library, then locating the <strong>Caches</strong> folder.

These tools can bypass macOS and show you <em>all</em> of your files in the system.

Start with <strong>System Junk</strong>. For the most thorough scan, grant the app Full Disk Access.

Once it’s done, click “<strong>Review Details</strong>,” and you’ll see a complete list of the files that CleanMyMacX found to be wasting space. Click “<strong>Show</strong>” next to each item to see a full breakdown of the files underneath. Right-click on each, then choose “<strong>Reveal in Finder</strong>” to go directly to the junk file. </p><div contenteditable=\"false\" data-hidecredit=\"false\" data-imagerights=\"other-license\" data-syndicationrights=\"false\" data-format=\"png\" data-height=\"1402\" data-id=\"191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"2392\" draggable=\"false\"><p><span><div><p><img alt=\"Image for article titled How to Delete Space-Hogging &amp;#39;Other&amp;#39; Files on Your Mac\" data-alt=\"Image for article titled How to Delete Space-Hogging &amp;#39;Other&amp;#39; Files on Your Mac\" data-anim-src=\"\" data-chomp-id=\"191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab\" data-format=\"png\" data-srcset=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,pg_1,q_80,w_80/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 80w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_140/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 140w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_265/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 265w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_340/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 340w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_490/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 490w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_645/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 645w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_740/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 740w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_965/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 965w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1165/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 1165w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1315/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 1315w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1465/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 1465w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1600/191000b031b6f28ced01765c2770b6ab.png 1600w\" draggable=\"auto\" sizes=\"     (max-width: 25em) calc(100vw - 32px),     (max-width: 37.31em) calc(100vw - 32px),     (min-width: 37.37em) and (max-width: 49.94em) calc(100vw - 32px),     (min-width: 50em) and (max-width: 63.69em) 800px,     (min-width: 63.75em) and (max-width: 85.19em) calc(66.5vw - 32px),     800px    \" src=\"/calibre/LifeHacker--Wed--25-Aug-2021----/feed_0/article_10/images/img2.png\"></p></div></span></p></div><p>Now you can simply delete that file, return to CleanMyMacX, and repeat the process for all the files you’d like gone.

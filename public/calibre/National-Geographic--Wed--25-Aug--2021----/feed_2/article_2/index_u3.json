Rabinor estimates that “midsized hotels with large beachfronts are <a href=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/removing-sargassum-from-beaches-proves-costly-for-hotels/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">spending thousands of dollars a day</a> [on removal], if not more, during peak moments.”</p>\n<p>Travel agent Mallory Jones visited the Riviera Maya in May 2021.

It’s just too unpredictable.”</p>\n<h2><b>Removal by rake, tractor, or boat</b></h2>\n<p>Removing or deflecting pounds and pounds of seaweed, which sometimes washes in with every wave, isn’t just a matter of scooping the stuff up in a bucket and throwing it out.</p>\n<p>The offshore seaweed barriers use netting or floating bumpers to catch or <a href=\"https://www.elastec.com/floating-debris-seaweed-barrrier/?gclid=CjwKCAjw3_KIBhA2EiwAaAAlikLKxXuFITvkbMIN9uFoks55xgz02L53FSCAN1ae4Otwsuo9z3hGRRoCoQwQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">block sargassum</a>. Boats equipped with scooping mechanisms can also lift plant matter out of the water, but they can be expensive. “Only a few hotels have these boats,” Rosa Rodríguez-Martínez, a researcher at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, who has studied sargassum since 2015. “Most use the barriers to deviate the algae to ‘sacrifice spots’ and use mechanical bands or bulldozers to upload the algae to trucks.”</p>\n<p>Some hotels dispose of sargassum on nearby land, while others take it to disposal sites in the jungle. “None of the disposal sites, however, have been adequately prepared to avoid leachates [contaminated liquids] from reaching the aquifer,” Rodríguez-Martínez adds.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador <a href=\"https://www.mexicanist.com/l/cancun-seaweed-sargassum/\" target=\"_blank\">enlisted the Mexican navy</a> to help stop the tide of seaweed before it hit the coastline.

But the seaweed just keeps coming.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Workers remove Sargassum seaweed at Mamitas Beach in Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo state, Mexico on August 19, 2018. Sargassum—a brown seaweed that lives in the open ocean—has overwhelmed shorelines along the East Coast of the United States, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean. Researchers say that the Sargassum outbreak started in 2011, but it has become worse over the years and could cause a serious environmental disaster. As the Sargassum is cleaned up on the shorelines, in a matter of days the shorelines are once again filled. When the Sargassum seaweed lands and starts to decompose, a toxic hydrogen sulfide gas is released, spreading an unpleasant odor and potentially causing adverse health effects. Apart from being an annoyance for tourists, Sargassum also affects oxygen levels in the water, brings contaminants and other microorganisms to the beach, changes the ecological balance of coral and causes beach erosion when its removed in such large quantities. There are several factors that could explain the proliferation of Sargassum in recent years. These include the rise of sea temperatures, the change of sea currents due to climate change and nutrients dumped into the ocean from farming and deforestation around the world.

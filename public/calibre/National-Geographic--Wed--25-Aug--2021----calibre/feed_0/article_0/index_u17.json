But, when the pandemic hit, Ruzo was faced with a different sort of “home” challenge, one that required a fast, smart solution for his family.

Ruzo’s father, who was considered high-risk for COVID19 due to heart health issues, mother, and several members of his close, extended family live in Dallas, Texas.

They eagerly welcomed Andrés, Sofia, and Silvano back to Dallas, and offered to let them live rent-free in a stand-alone bungalow suite formerly occupied by Andrés’ grandmother. Moving to Dallas solved some pressing practical problems, such as childcare and ensuring his parents stayed safe, but more importantly, says Ruzo, it was “the natural thing to do.” He explains, “We did not evolve as human beings to be alone. It is human instinct to come together.”</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Andres and child canoe\" src=\"/calibre/National-Geographic--Wed--25-Aug--2021----calibre/feed_0/article_0/images/img2_u2.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Andrés and Silvano hop in the canoe to discover the local ecosystems near their home. </p>\n<p>Photograph by Celeste Sloman</p>\n<h2><b></b></h2>\n<p>While they didn’t realize it at the time, the Ruzos were part of an upward trend in multigenerational households, which began before the pandemic but rose dramatically as the lockdowns began. In the early months of the pandemic, job losses, the switch to remote learning at colleges and universities, and other factors caused record numbers of young adults to move in with one or both parents. According to an <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/04/a-majority-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-live-with-their-parents-for-the-first-time-since-the-great-depression/\" target=\"_blank\">analysis</a> from the Pew Research Center, some 52 percent of 18-to-29 year-olds in the U.S. live with their parents.

That’s something that is very Latin American and something I want for Silvano.”</p>\n<p>He also wants more rooms for his family to spread out.

But, by far, the most creative reimagining of a space was the bathroom, which doubled as Ruzo’s lab.

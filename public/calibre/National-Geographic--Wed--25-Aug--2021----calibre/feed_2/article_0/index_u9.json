From there, it continues west 1,078 miles through <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destination/idaho\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Idaho</a> and into <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destination/washington\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Washington State</a>, where it joins the Columbia River. Sections of the headwaters and the Snake are part of the <a href=\"https://www.rivers.gov/wsr-act.php\" target=\"_blank\">National Wild and Scenic Rivers System</a>, a federal designation that preserves sections and entire lengths of 226 rivers across the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destination/united-states\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United States</a>.</p>\n<p>Like other nationally designated waterways, the Snake has important ecological characteristics. In southern Idaho, it feeds the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/aquifers-and-groundwater?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects\" target=\"_blank\">Snake River Aquifer</a>, one of the country’s <a href=\"https://snakeriverwaterkeeper.org/the-river/\" target=\"_blank\">most productive sources of groundwater</a>. The headwaters alone are one of the few remaining intact <a href=\"https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/technical/?cid=nrcs143_014199\" target=\"_blank\">riparian ecosystems</a> (areas where land and water meet, such as flood plains) in the contiguous U.S.</p>\n<p>Yet Wild and Scenic Rivers are historically under surveyed, and the water quality of <a href=\"https://www.rivers.gov/documents/state-water-quality-assessments.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 40 percent</a> of them is categorized as either unknown or unassessed, says Adventure Scientists founder and executive director Gregg Treinish, who was named a <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/adventurer-and-conservationist-gregg-treinish/\" target=\"_blank\">National Geographic Emerging Explorer in 2013</a>.</p>\n<p>Adventure Scientists is partnering with a variety of agencies, including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Park Service</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Forest Service</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bureau of Land Management</a>, on a five-year endeavor to enlist volunteers like Hackett to gather data on the Snake River.

<ul class="calibre_feed_list"><li class="calibre5">On August 18, the Biden administration announced that it is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/18/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/#link-XD3L2L2TM5DTJMTHIIU3YKZ7PA" target="_blank">planning to roll out booster shots</a> of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on September 20. The administration’s top health officials said in a joint statement that they recommend getting a booster shot eight months after receiving a second dose of one of the two mRNA vaccines. The rollout will begin with nursing home residents, health care workers, and emergency workers. First, however, the FDA will need to authorize the additional shots.</li><li class="calibre5">The administration also expects to recommend a second dose for those who received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine but is awaiting the results of a clinical trial studying the shot’s two-dose regimen. Pfizer has already submitted data on its booster shot to the FDA.</li><li class="calibre5">The Biden administration cited studies showing that the <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/studies-covid-vaccine-protection-waning-against-infection-not" target="_blank">vaccines’ protections are waning against mild and moderate disease</a>, particularly in the face of the more transmissible Delta variant. Although the vaccines remain effective against severe disease, officials said the decision to roll out boosters is an attempt to stay ahead of the virus. Officials cited data from Israel, which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-health-israel-coronavirus-pandemic-775e772a7507bcab708e9eea4bdcc50a" target="_blank">has already begun administering boosters</a> amid evidence of declining protection from severe disease among its elderly population.</li><li class="calibre5">The news comes just days after the U.S. authorized the use of boosters <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-vaccine-dose-certain-immunocompromised" target="_blank">among people with weakened immune systems</a>—and weeks after the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-4-august-2021" target="_blank">called for a moratorium on booster shots</a> as it attempts to address inequities in the global vaccine rollout.</li><li class="calibre5">A preprint study published this week shows that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.09.21261290v4" target="_blank">antibody levels can predict the Moderna vaccine’s efficacy against COVID-19</a>. The analysis of breakthrough infections shows that people with lower level of antibodies were more likely to develop a symptomatic infection than those with higher levels.</li><li class="calibre5">Another preprint study out of the U.K. shows that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines remain effective against the Delta variant, although <a href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/files/coronavirus/covid-19-infection-survey/finalfinalcombinedve20210816.pdf" target="_blank">their efficacy wanes over time</a>. Pfizer’s vaccine declined more rapidly, reaching comparable levels to the AstraZeneca vaccine after four to five months after the second dose.</li></ul>
<p class="calibre11">COVID-19 vaccines have reached consumers in record time. Though the process can typically take <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/">10 to 15 years</a>, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency authorization to vaccines made by Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson in less than a year. Before now, the fastest-ever vaccine—for mumps—<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-coronavirus-vaccine-could-take-way-longer-than-a-year">took four years</a> to develop in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="calibre11">Even after a vaccine is authorized or fully licensed, it faces potential roadblocks when it comes to scaling up production and distribution, which also includes <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/07/01/covid-vaccine-ethics-faden/">deciding which populations should get it first</a>—and at what cost.</p>
<p class="calibre11">Yet several efforts are underway to help produce and distribute the vaccines more quickly. Here’s everything you need to know—including primers on <a href="index_u14.html#vaccineclinicaltrials">how vaccines and clinical trials work</a>, the latest news on <a href="index_u14.html#vaccinerollout">vaccine distribution and safety</a>, and a <a href="index_u14.html#vaccineprospects">detailed breakdown of each of the candidates</a> that have reached phase three and beyond.</p>
<h2 class="calibre12">Vaccines and clinical trials<a id="vaccineclinicaltrials" class="calibre19"></a></h2>
<p class="calibre11"><a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines">More than 60 vaccines </a>are still going through <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/test-approve.html">a three-stage clinical trial process</a> that’s required before they are sent to regulatory agencies for approval. Given the urgent need, some vaccine developers have compressed the clinical process for SARS-CoV-2 by running trial phases simultaneously.</p>
<h3 class="calibre8">VACCINE CLINICAL TRIAL PROCESS</h3>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Phase one:</b> Checks the safety of a vaccine and determines whether it triggers an immune response in a small group of healthy humans. </p><p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Phase two:</b> Widens the testing pool to include groups of people who may have the disease or be more likely to catch it, to gauge the vaccine’s effectiveness. </p><p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Phase three:</b> Expands the pool up to the thousands to make sure the vaccine is safe and effective among a wider array of people, given that immune response can vary by age, ethnicity, or by underlying health conditions.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The COVID-19 candidates, like all vaccines, essentially aim to instruct the immune system to mount a defense, which is sometimes <a href="https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/immune-system-and-health">stronger than what would be provided through natural infection</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/tools/vaccinfosheets/en/">comes</a> with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/history/index.html">fewer health consequences</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre11">To do so, traditional vaccines use the whole coronavirus, but in a killed or weakened state. Others use only part of the virus—whether a protein or a fragment. Some transfer the instructions for coronavirus proteins into an unrelated virus that is unlikely or even incapable of causing disease. Finally, cutting-edge vaccines under development rely on deploying pieces of the coronavirus’s genetic material, enabling our cells to temporarily make coronavirus proteins needed to stimulate our immune systems. (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/searching-for-coronavirus-vaccine-how-would-it-work">Find out more about vaccines and how they work</a>.)</p>
<h3 class="calibre8">TYPES OF VACCINES</h3>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Nucleic acid:</b> Relies on injecting snippets of a virus’s genetic material, either DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA), into human cells. It spurs the production of viral proteins that mimic features of the coronavirus, training the immune system to recognize its presence. </p><p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Knocked-out virus:</b> Uses a non-infectious form of the coronavirus that can no longer cause full-blown disease but can still provoke an immune response. The virus can either be fully inactivated or weakened. These modes are considered the most classic ways to make vaccines.</p><p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Viral vector:</b> Essentially a “Trojan horse” presented to the immune system. One type involves introducing a piece of DNA from SARS-CoV-2 into another unrelated germ—for example, an adenovirus, which typically causes the common cold. When this modified adenovirus is injected into humans, the hope is that it will instruct cells to make coronavirus proteins and will trigger an immune response.</p><p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Protein:</b> These vaccines are typically made from coronavirus proteins, which can be synthesized or brewed in labs like beer. Some versions involve coating a carrier—such as nanoparticles—with proteins to better aid delivery and uptake by cells.</p>
<h2 class="calibre12">U.S. vaccine rollout<a id="vaccinerollout" class="calibre19"></a></h2>
<p class="calibre11">In the United States, more than 60 percent of the population has received at least one dose, and 51 percent are fully vaccinated. As of August 20, the U.S. had administered <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 359 million shots</a> of the authorized vaccines and had distributed more than 422 million doses.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On August 18, the Biden administration announced that it <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0818-covid-19-booster-shots.html" target="_blank">plans to begin offering booster shots</a> of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on September 20. The administration’s top health officials said in a joint statement that they advise Americans to get the boosters eight months after their second dose. The rollout of third doses will begin with nursing home residents, health care workers, and emergency workers. </p>
<p class="calibre11">First, however, the FDA must authorize the use of additional doses, which the Washington Post reports that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/18/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/#link-XD3L2L2TM5DTJMTHIIU3YKZ7PA" target="_blank">approval is expected in the coming weeks</a>. Those who received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine will likely also be eligible for a second dose, but officials are first waiting on the results of a clinical trial testing the vaccine’s two-dose regimen.</p>
<p class="calibre11">Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control, said in a press conference that the Biden administration has decided to roll out booster shots in an attempt to stay ahead of the virus. Although the data shows that the vaccine still offer strong protection against severe disease, Walensky says the data <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/studies-covid-vaccine-protection-waning-against-infection-not" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consistently demonstrate a waning effectiveness against mild and moderate disease</a> as well as declining efficacy against the Delta variant. She pointed to data from other countries—including Israel, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-health-israel-coronavirus-pandemic-775e772a7507bcab708e9eea4bdcc50a" target="_blank">has already begun administering booster shots</a>—indicating that protections against severe disease “could decrease in the months ahead.”</p>
<p class="calibre11">The news comes just weeks after the WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-4-august-2021" target="_blank">called for a moratorium on booster shots through at least September</a> to help efforts to vaccinate at least 10 percent of people in every country. The organization asked wealthy nations to share their doses instead of administering boosters. “We cannot and should not accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press conference.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The U.S. has already amended the emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-vaccine-dose-certain-immunocompromised" target="_blank">to allow administration of a third dose</a> to people who have had solid organ transplants or who are equally immunocompromised. The two-dose regimen seems to be less effective in protecting against COVID-19 for people with weakened immune systems, who are more likely to become seriously ill from the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0813-additional-mRNA-mrna-dose.html" target="_blank">endorsed the FDA’s decision</a> on August 13 following a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee. Shots are expected to be available immediately..</p>
<p class="calibre11">Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health have <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-study-third-covid-19-vaccine-dose-kidney-transplant-recipients" target="_blank">launched phase two clinical trials</a> to assess whether a third dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines would produce a protective antibody response among kidney transplant recipients whose immune systems did not respond to the first two doses.</p>
<p class="calibre11">Vaccines remain effective at preventing most severe illness, even for <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/scientists-urge-local-mask-mandates-as-delta-sweeps-the-us" target="_blank">breakthrough infections of the Delta variant</a>. But there's concern over the potential for transmission. On July 30, the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w" target="_blank">published </a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w" target="_blank">preliminary data</a> from a Massachusetts COVID-19 outbreak that suggests vaccinated individuals who are infected with the Delta variant may carry similar viral loads as an unvaccinated infected individual. Those data come in the form of proxies based on how quickly samples from the infected people yielded a positive SARS-CoV-2 result. The data will require follow-up research to confirm.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On July 29, U.S. President Joe Biden said that his administration is rolling out a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/29/remarks-by-president-biden-laying-out-the-next-steps-in-our-effort-to-get-more-americans-vaccinated-and-combat-the-spread-of-the-delta-variant/" target="_blank">COVID-19 vaccine policy</a> for federal employees. Employees who do not disclose their vaccination status or are unvaccinated must wear masks at work, test for COVID-19 once or twice a week, socially distance, and stop almost all travel for work.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has mandated that <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5696" target="_blank">its 115,000 frontline healthcare workers must be vaccinated</a> and, on August 9, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told troops that <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2021/Aug/09/2002826254/-1/-1/0/Message-to-the-Force-Memo-Vaccine-FINAL.PDF" target="_blank">COVID-19 vaccines will be mandatory for active duty service members</a> “no later than mid-September.” Austin noted the mandate could come into force even sooner if the FDA grants full approval to Pfizer’s vaccine first—which the regulatory agency is expected to do according to news reports that say the FDA is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/pfizer-vaccine-approval.html" target="_blank">speeding up its timeline to approve the vaccine by early September</a>. State and local governments <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/10/world/covid-delta-variant-vaccine#as-the-delta-variant-tears-across-the-us-vaccine-and-mask-mandates-gain-momentum" target="_blank">are also implementing vaccine mandates</a> among their employees. On August 11, California became the first state to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-education-california-coronavirus-pandemic-7699f4496101d261ac94ed22e7544417" target="_blank">require all teachers and school staff</a> to either get a vaccine or undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. The mandate goes into effect on October 15.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On July 27, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-the-cdc-reversed-course-on-masks-indoors-and-how-it-might-affect-you" target="_blank">updated its recommendations on masks</a>. The agency now urges their universal use in indoor public spaces by people living in regions with at least “substantial” COVID-19 transmission, where 50 or more new cases per 100,000 people have been reported over the past seven days. More than two thirds of all U.S. counties have “substantial” spread or higher, and cases are trending upward nationwide.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The CDC also recommends indoor masking in public spaces for vaccinated people who live with anyone vulnerable to the disease, such as unvaccinated children and immunocompromised individuals. All teachers, students, and staff in schools, whether vaccinated or not, should also wear masks, according to the new CDC guidance.</p>
<p class="calibre11">Unvaccinated individuals likely still account for the greatest viral transmission, since the total number of breakthrough cases is relatively low, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, stressed during the July 27 briefing.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0512-advisory-committee-signing.html" target="_blank">approved</a> Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use in adolescents ages 12 to 15, which is seen as key to helping the country reach herd immunity. States, which are still responsible for rollout decision making, subsequently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/world/adults-eligible-covid-vaccine.html" target="_blank">widened eligibility</a> to include all people 12 and older. </p>
<p class="calibre11">But the country’s immunization campaign remains focused on adults who have been less eager to get the vaccine. Efforts include a <a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/" target="_blank">website</a> to help people find vaccines, as well as an increase in walk-up vaccination sites, pop-up clinics, and increased funding and access to clinics in rural areas. On June 2, Biden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-government-and-politics-health-8168ae1c68ca955b620082d862c911ad" target="_blank">announced</a> a new slew of incentives and efforts to remove barriers to vaccination, from free beer to free childcare coverage. Pharmacies are also extending their hours, and the Biden administration is partnering with Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons to administer the vaccines.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The Biden administration has dedicated nearly $20 billion to the vaccine rollout as part of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/National-Strategy-for-the-COVID-19-Response-and-Pandemic-Preparedness.pdf" target="_blank">$1.9 trillion COVID-19 rescue package</a> proposed in January and signed by Biden on March 11.</p>
<h2 class="calibre12">Global vaccine rollout</h2>
<p class="calibre11">The World Health Organization is also coordinating global efforts to administer vaccines, with an eye toward <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/26-06-2020-act-accelerator-update" target="_blank">delivering two billion doses</a> by the end of 2021. It is leading an initiative through the COVAX Facility to ensure that all countries have equitable access. COVAX <a href="https://www.gavi.org/covax-vaccine-roll-out" target="_blank">has distributed</a> more than 209 million doses to 138 participants. The WHO has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca-Oxford, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna, Sinopharm, and Sinovac vaccines for emergency use.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On May 27, however, COVAX acknowledged that the crisis in India created a shortfall of 190 million doses. <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/27-05-2021-covax-joint-statement-call-to-action-to-equip-covax-to-deliver-2-billion-doses-in-2021" target="_blank">In a joint statement</a>, COVAX administrators said the consequences of that shortfall “could be catastrophic.” They called on world leaders to share more doses and commit additional funding to the global effort. On June 3, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/03/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-unveils-strategy-for-global-vaccine-sharing-announcing-allocation-plan-for-the-first-25-million-doses-to-be-shared-globally/" target="_blank">said</a> that it will share 80 million doses by the end of June; 75 percent of those doses will be shared through COVAX and the rest will go to countries experiencing surges and to U.S. neighbors. The U.S. also <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/10/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-historic-vaccine-donation-half-a-billion-pfizer-vaccines-to-the-worlds-lowest-income-nations/" target="_blank">announced on June 11</a> that it will purchase 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and donate them to low- and middle-income countries. Two hundred million doses will be delivered by the end of 2021 and the rest will be delivered in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On June 13, national leaders at the G7 summit <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-06-2021-g7-announces-pledges-of-870-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-of-which-at-least-half-to-be-delivered-by-the-end-of-2021" target="_blank">announced plans</a> to donate 870 million doses to the global vaccination effort. Most of the doses will be distributed through COVAX, with the aim to deliver at least half of them by the end of 2021. Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210521-pharma-firms-g20-leaders-pledge-vaccines-for-poorer-nations" target="_blank">have also pledged to collectively provide around 3.5 billion doses</a> of their vaccines to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022. The European Union also said it would donate at least 100 million doses by the end of 2021. On August 6, China <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-health-china-coronavirus-pandemic-7b3a7e0f5949b6976d4cf7f69bba71d0" target="_blank">pledged to provide two billion doses</a> of its COVID-19 vaccines this year and donate $100 million to COVAX. </p>
<p class="calibre11">Still, on July 16, the <i class="calibre16">New York Times </i>reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/16/world/africa/africa-vaccination-rollout.html" target="_blank">vaccine shortages are driving a COVID-19 crisis in Africa</a>, where only 1 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated. </p>
<h2 class="calibre12">Vaccine safety</h2>
<p class="calibre11">On July 13, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-july-13-2021" target="_blank">added a warning label</a> to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine after it was linked to rare cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that can lead to paralysis. There have been 100 preliminary reports of the syndrome among the approximately 12.5 million people who have received the vaccine. The FDA said that the benefits of receiving the vaccine outweigh the risks.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The FDA has also added a warning label to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines about <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/heart-problems-after-vaccinations-are-very-rareand-often-resolve-quickly" target="_blank">rare cases of heart inflammation</a> in adolescents and young adults.  The news comes after the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/heart-problems-after-vaccinations-are-very-rareand-often-resolve-quickly" target="_blank">announced</a> that it has identified more than 300 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis that it acknowledged are likely linked to the vaccines. The agency says these cases are rare but higher than expected. It also said the benefits of the shots outweigh the risks.</p>
<p class="calibre11"> An earlier CDC report <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm?s_cid=mm7008e3_x" target="_blank">released February 19</a> revealed that severe reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are rare. The report documented only 4.5 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of vaccine administered during the reporting period, which the CDC notes is comparable with rates for other types of vaccines. U.K. regulators <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n363" target="_blank">have also published safety data</a> for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine showing that most side effects are mild and consistent with what is typical of other vaccines. Still, as a precautionary measure, U.K. officials have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-64ddccd70c38a39f880da27941db3540" target="_blank">advised people</a> with a history of serious allergic reactions not to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.</p>
<p class="calibre11">In April, the European Medicines Agency issued statements saying that unusual blood clots should be listed as a very rare but possible side effect of both the <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood" target="_blank">AstraZeneca</a> and <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-janssen-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood" target="_blank">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a> vaccines. In a review of 86 reported cases related to the AstraZeneca vaccine, the EMA’s safety committee found a potential link between it and the clots, with most known cases occurring in women under age 60 within two weeks of receiving the first dose. The EMA continues to stress that the odds of developing a clot after vaccination are extremely low, and that the benefits of getting vaccinated outweigh the risks. They also recommend that people seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms related to clotting, including persistent pain, shortness of breath, and headaches or blurred vision.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On August 11, the CDC officially recommended that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0811-vaccine-safe-pregnant.html" target="_blank">people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or may become pregnant get a COVID-19 vaccine</a>. A new analysis of data from the vaccine rollout found no increased risk of miscarriage among people who received an mRNA vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Earlier studies also showed that the vaccine is safe later in pregnancy as well—for both pregnant people and their babies.</p>
<p class="calibre11">CDC director Rochelle Walensky <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/549965-cdc-declares-it-recommends-pregnant-people-get-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank">had previously suggested in April </a>that pregnant people receive the COVID-19 vaccine, but the CDC’s official guidelines simply said that pregnant people were eligible for the jab. At the time, Walensky pointed to a recent study <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983" target="_blank">published in the <i class="calibre16">New England Journal of Medicine</i></a> that showed no safety concerns among pregnant people who received the mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.</p>

<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Who:</b> A Massachusetts-based biotech company, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">What:</b> A nucleic-acid vaccine that requires two doses. </p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Latest news:</b> A new preprint analysis of Moderna’s vaccine suggests that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.09.21261290v4" target="_blank">antibody levels can predict the vaccine’s efficacy</a> against COVID-19. The study showed that people with breakthrough infections who had lower levels of antibodies in their blood were more likely to develop symptomatic infections than those with higher levels of antibodies. The study authors tell <i class="calibre16">Nature</i> that the data doesn’t suggest a threshold of antibodies that ensures protection but it does show <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02237-8#ref-CR1" target="_blank">a relationship between higher levels of antibodies and lower risk of infection</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Approval status:</b> On December 18, the FDA <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/17/covid-fda-moderna-vaccine-2/" target="_blank">granted emergency approval</a> to Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, a day after an advisory panel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/health/covid-vaccine-fda-moderna.html" target="_blank">decided 20-0</a>, with one abstention, that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, such as the mild side effects reported in their clinical trial. The vaccine has also been approved in the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/europe/moderna-approval-eu-intl/index.html" target="_blank">European Union</a>, <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/health-canada-authorizes-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-canada" target="_blank">Canada</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/moderna-vaccine-becomes-third-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-uk-regulator" target="_blank">U.K.</a>, <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/israeli-ministry-health-authorizes-covid-19-vaccine-moderna-use" target="_blank">Israel</a><span class="calibre18">,</span> and <a href="https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-mrna-vaccine-nucleoside-modified" target="_blank">by the WHO</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On June 1, Moderna <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-initiation-rolling-submission-biologics" target="_blank">announced</a> that it has applied for full FDA approval of its COVID-19 vaccine for use in people age 18 and older. The company also plans to file for emergency use authorization for teens ages 12 to 17. A <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-teencove-study-its-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank">study</a> of clinical trials among adolescents in this age group shows that its vaccine is safe and 100 percent effective. The study also showed the vaccine is 93 percent effective among participants in this age group two weeks after the first dose.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Distribution:</b> Moderna’s candidate was the second vaccine to receive emergency authorization in the U.S., joining <a href="index_u14.html#pfizer" target="_blank">Pfizer’s candidate</a>. On December 11, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/12/11/trump-administration-purchases-additional-100-million-doses-covid-19-investigational-vaccine-moderna.html" target="_blank">purchased an additional 100 million doses</a> of Moderna’s vaccine. Two months later, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/politics/biden-coronavirus-vaccines.html" target="_blank">procured an additional 100 million doses,</a> for a total of 300 million by the end of July.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On April 2, Moderna <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-storage-update-announces-us-fda-authorizes-15" target="_blank">announced</a> that the FDA has authorized it to increase the number of doses in its vials from 10 to 11. Regulators are also permitting the company to use new vials that allow for 15 doses. The FDA also said that Moderna’s vaccine can now be kept at room temperature for up to a day. The vaccine <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/11/moderna-edges-pfizer-coronavirus-efficacy-and-refrigeration/" target="_blank">can otherwise be safely stored on ice</a> or in a normal refrigerator for 30 days. These changes are expected to help the company distribute its vaccine more quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The company also says it remains on track to deliver at least 500 million doses globally per year beginning in 2021, thanks in part to <a href="https://www.lonza.com/news/2020-05-01-04-50" target="_blank">a deal it has struck with Swiss manufacturer Lonza</a> that will allow it to manufacture up to a billion doses a year.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On July 16, the U.S. said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-will-ship-35-million-covid-19-vaccines-argentina-2021-07-16/" target="_blank">it will begin shipping 3.5 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine to Argentina</a> as part of a bilateral deal between the countries. The U.S. has also shared doses of its vaccines with Taiwan, Brazil, El Salvador, Pakistan, and other countries.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Efficacy: </b>On August 8, a preliminary Mayo Clinic study of more than 50,000 patients suggested that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">Moderna’s vaccine is more effective against the Delta variant than Pfizer’s vaccine</a>. The study shows that the efficacy of Moderna’s vaccine dropped from 86 percent in early 2021 to 76 percent in July, when the Delta variant was predominant. Meanwhile, the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy dropped over the same time period from 76 percent to 42 percent. The study notes that both vaccines remain highly effective at preventing severe cases of disease.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On August 12, a study published in the journal <i class="calibre16">Science</i> showed that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/08/11/science.abj4176?_ga=2.235822593.145620917.1628696888-1399774036.1602427045" target="_blank">Moderna’s vaccine protects against COVID-19 for at least six months</a> and is effective against the Delta variant. The findings confirm <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916?query=featured_home" target="_blank">earlier studies</a> and announcements made by the company that its vaccine <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial" target="_blank">remains 93 percent effective for at least six months</a> after administration of the second dose.</p>
<p class="calibre11">Moderna also said that a study of the phase two clinical trials of its three booster candidates produced robust antibody responses against the virus, including the Gamma, Beta, and Delta variants of concern. The company has submitted its study data for publication. The company said it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/moderna-covid-vaccine-booster-produces-robust-response-against-delta.html" target="_blank">expects boosters will likely be needed before the winter season</a>; however, the World Health Organization has called for <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-4-august-2021" target="_blank">a moratorium on booster shots through at least September</a> given the global vaccine disparity.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/health/coronavirus-vaccines-immunity.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank">As the <i class="calibre16">New York Times</i> reported</a> in June, however, past studies suggest that people who are immunized with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines may not need booster shots. A study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03738-2_reference.pdf" target="_blank">published in the journal <i class="calibre16">Nature</i></a> on June 28 showed that the vaccines elicit “robust and prolonged” immune responses—indicating that protection may last for years so long as the virus doesn’t mutate to evade it.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On July 9, <i class="calibre16">Nature</i> reported on a study showing that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01893-0" target="_blank">two quarter-doses of Moderna’s vaccine generates long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and T cells</a>. The results suggest that it might be possible to administer fractional doses to help stretch the world’s vaccine supply, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that are facing shortages.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On February 17, the <i class="calibre16">New England Journal of Medicine</i> <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102179?query=featured_home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> a preliminary report showing that Moderna’s vaccine remains effective in protecting against the virus variant found in the U.K. However, it may be less effective in protecting against the South African variant—although researchers noted that further study is needed. </p>
<p class="calibre11">In December 2020, an FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a> of the phase three study of Moderna’s vaccine confirmed that it is 94.1-percent effective in preventing mild cases of COVID-19 and 100-percent effective at preventing severe cases after taking two doses.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Safety:</b> On June 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-panel-review-heart-inflammation-cases-after-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-2021-06-23/" target="_blank">said</a> it plans to add a warning label to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines about <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/heart-problems-after-vaccinations-are-very-rareand-often-resolve-quickly" target="_blank">rare cases of heart inflammation</a> in adolescents and young adults. The news comes after the CDC convened an emergency meeting of its advisory committee to discuss “rare but higher-than-expected” cases of myocarditis and pericarditis among young people who have received the vaccines. The committee acknowledged that these cases are likely linked to the vaccines but that the benefits of the shots outweigh the risks.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Clinical trials status:</b> Moderna announced on December 17 that it is launching clinical trials to evaluate the vaccine’s safety in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-12-17-20/h_d8ba867ebfe7300a65bda99cc2e2babd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">children and people with cancer</a>; it will also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-12-17-20/h_9a24ba453f4fd361f19264327ac63a1a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">establish a “pregnancy registry</a>” to track the vaccine’s safety in people who are pregnant. </p>
<p class="calibre11">The company <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-phase-3-cove-study-mrna-vaccine-against-covid" target="_blank">started</a> the third phase of its clinical trials in July 2020. Preliminary findings from its phase one trials showed that healthy subjects—<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/26/moderna-says-its-coronavirus-vaccine-shows-promising-results-in-small-trial-of-elderly-patients.html" target="_blank">including elderly patients</a>—produced coronavirus antibodies and a reaction from T cells, another part of the human immune response. Phase three is testing the vaccine in 30,000 U.S. participants. The company also announced plans to <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/d427592c-dab4-4715-a568-31207d9832ab" target="_blank">test the safety and efficacy</a> of a booster shot that would be delivered a year after the first pair of vaccine doses, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/moderna-looks-to-test-covid-19-booster-shots-a-year-after-initial-vaccination.html" target="_blank">according to CNBC</a>. The trial will likely begin in July 2021.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On February 24, Moderna <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-it-has-shipped-variant-specific-vaccine" target="_blank">announced</a> that it has shipped doses of a booster vaccine to the U.S. National Institutes of Health for clinical trials. The phase one trial will determine whether the booster can improve immunity against the South Africa variant. Moderna is also investigating using a third dose of its approved vaccine to protect against variants.</p>
<h2 class="calibre12"><a href="https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="calibre19"><b class="calibre13">Pfizer</b></a></h2>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Name:</b> BNT162b2</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Who:</b> One of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, based in New York, in collaboration with German biotech company BioNTech.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">What:</b> A nucleic-acid vaccine that requires two doses taken 21 days apart.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Latest news: </b>A preprint study out of the United Kingdom shows that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines remain protective against the Delta variant <a href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/files/coronavirus/covid-19-infection-survey/finalfinalcombinedve20210816.pdf" target="_blank">but that their efficacy wanes over time</a>. Among study participants, Pfizer’s vaccine waned more rapidly. Within four to five months after a second dose, the vaccine’s efficacy was on par with the AstraZeneca shot. The study emphasizes, however, the both vaccines still significantly reduce the risk of infection.</p>
<p class="calibre11">A study published in <i class="calibre16">Nature</i> has demonstrated that people who have received both doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03777-9" target="_blank">remain fully protected against severe disease, hospitalization, and death</a> from the Delta and Beta variants. However, a single dose of either vaccine was not as protective.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The findings corroborate an earlier study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03738-2_reference.pdf" target="_blank">published in <i class="calibre16">Nature</i></a> showing that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines elicit “robust and prolonged” immune responses. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/health/coronavirus-vaccines-immunity.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank">As the New York Times reported</a>, the findings suggest that people who are immunized with these vaccines may not need booster shots as protection may last for years so long as the virus doesn’t mutate to evade it.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Approval status: </b>On December 2, 2020, the U.K. became <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-authorises-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank">the first Western country</a> to approve any COVID-19 vaccine when it authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech candidate—making the drug the first mRNA vaccine in history allowed for human use. The FDA <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/health/pfizer-vaccine-authorized.html?action=click&amp;module=Top Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank">granted emergency approval</a> to this vaccine on December 11. The vaccine has also been <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/vaccine-rollout-plan-phac-1.5833912" target="_blank">granted emergency approval</a> in Canada, the <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-receive-authorization-european-union" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Union</a>, and other countries.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On May 12, the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0512-advisory-committee-signing.html" target="_blank">approved</a> Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use in adolescents ages 12 to 15. U.K. regulators have also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-approves-pfizerbiontech-covid-shot-12-15-year-olds-2021-06-04/" target="_blank">approved</a> this vaccine for use in the same age group, while the European Union <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-receive-first-authorization-european" target="_blank">granted conditional authorization</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On May 7, Pfizer started its application for full FDA approval of its vaccine for people ages 16 and up. The Biden administration has said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/pfizer-vaccine-approval.html" target="_blank">approval could come in early September</a>. Pfizer also expects to have data that will potentially allow it to file for emergency use authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 2 to 11 in late September. </p>
<p class="calibre11">Pfizer and BioNTech also plan to <a href="https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2021-07/Delta_Variant_Study_Press_Statement_Final_7.8.21.pdf?IPpR1xZjlwvaUMQ9sRn2FkePcBiRPGqw" target="_blank">seek FDA authorization for a booster shot</a> to help protect against the Delta variant, which is now the dominant strain in the U.S. The companies suggested that the third dose of their vaccine “may be needed within six to 12 months after full vaccination.” In August, the Biden administration said it planned to roll out booster shots of the mRNA vaccines on September 20, just a month after top health officials said that <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/07/08/joint-cdc-and-fda-statement-vaccine-boosters.html" target="_blank">fully vaccinated Americans “do not need a booster shot at this time</a>.” First, however, the FDA must authorize the use of boosters.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The announcement comes weeks after the World Health Organization called for <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-4-august-2021" target="_blank">a moratorium on booster shots through at least September</a>, given the global vaccination disparity. At a news conference, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus asked the wealthy nations that are considering administering boosters to instead donate the shots to low-income countries that are struggling to access the vaccine supply.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Distribution:</b> Pfizer and BioNTech <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-supply-united-states-100-million" target="_blank">have signed</a> several contracts with the U.S. government to provide 300 million doses by July 31, 2021.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The European Union <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/world/europe/EU-Pfizer-AstraZeneca-Covid.html" target="_blank">said</a> on April 14 that it has begun negotiations with Pfizer-BioNTech for 1.8 billion doses of their vaccines for 2022 and 2023. The move is part of the bloc’s plans to pivot away from the AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines in favor of the mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p class="calibre11">Globally, Pfizer expects to be able to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. Questions have been raised over the vaccine’s storage, which requires ultra-cold freezers set at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees F). On February 19, however, Pfizer and BioNTech <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-covid-19-vaccine-stability-data" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that their vaccine can remain stable for two weeks at temperatures between minus 25℃ and minus 15℃ (-13℉ to 5℉), a common range in pharmaceutical freezers and refrigerators. The finding would allow for easier distribution of the vaccine in communities where ultra-cold storage requirements present a challenge. The companies say they have submitted the new data to the FDA for review. </p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Efficacy: </b>On June 10, a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03693-y" target="_blank">published in the journal </a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03693-y" target="_blank"><i class="calibre16">Nature</i></a> showed that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine protects against several virus variants, including the <a href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/" target="_blank">Delta and Eta variants</a>. The news came a few days after the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0607-mrna-reduce-risks.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines reduce the risk of infection by 91 percent for fully vaccinated people.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On April 1, Pfizer and BioNTech <a href="https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-Confirm-High-Efficacy-and-No-Serious-Safety-Concerns-Through-Up-to-Six-Months-Following-Second-Dose-in-Updated-Topline-Analysis-of-Landmark-COVID-19-Vaccine-Study/default.aspx" target="_blank">announced</a> that their vaccine is 91.3 percent effective for at least six months after the second dose and 100 percent effective against the more contagious variant circulating in South Africa. The updated analysis of the vaccine’s phase three clinical trials also showed that it offers full protection against severe cases of COVID-19 with no serious safety concerns. A preliminary study also <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.09.443299v1" target="_blank">suggests</a> that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines protect against a more contagious variant that drove a surge in cases in India, B.1.617.2.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The CDC has also <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_e&amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM53321&amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR Early Release - Vol. 70, March 29, 2021&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM53321" target="_blank">released a study</a> of the U.S. vaccine rollout showing that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are 90 percent effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in real-world conditions. The study analyzed the efficacy of the two mRNA vaccines among nearly 4,000 health-care workers, first responders, and other frontline workers who were the first to receive the jab in the U.S. It also showed the vaccines are 80-percent effective after one dose. The findings confirm earlier studies from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/26/world/covid-19-coronavirus#pfizer-vaccine-protection" target="_blank">the U.K.</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736(21)00448-7" target="_blank">Israel</a>.</p>

Pfizer and BioNTech have also <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal" target="_blank">announced</a> that a phase three trial shows that their vaccine is safe and 100 percent efficacious among children between the ages of 12 and 15, and that it elicited robust antibody responses.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On February 17, the <i class="calibre16">New England Journal of Medicine</i> <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017?query=featured_home" target="_blank">published</a> a preliminary report showing that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine remains effective in protecting against the virus variants found in the U.K. and Brazil.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On March 11, Pfizer <a href="https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Real-World-Evidence-Confirms-High-Effectiveness-of-Pfizer-BioNTech-COVID-19-Vaccine-and-Profound-Public-Health-Impact-of-Vaccination-One-Year-After-Pandemic-Declared/default.aspx" target="_blank">announced</a> that preliminary findings from Israel’s rollout suggest its vaccine is effective at preventing COVID-19 transmission. The company says that its vaccine was 97-percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 94-percent effective against asymptomatic infections. Those findings are bolstered by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab229/6167855" target="_blank">a Mayo Clinic study</a> showing that the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna have been shown to significantly reduce asymptomatic transmission in the U.S.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Safety:</b> On June 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-panel-review-heart-inflammation-cases-after-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-2021-06-23/" target="_blank">said</a> it plans to add a warning label to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines about <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/heart-problems-after-vaccinations-are-very-rareand-often-resolve-quickly" target="_blank">rare cases of heart inflammation</a> in adolescents and young adults. The news comes after the CDC convened an emergency meeting of its advisory committee to discuss “rare but higher-than-expected” cases of myocarditis and pericarditis among young people who have received the vaccines. The committee acknowledged that these cases are likely linked to the vaccines but that the benefits of the shots outweigh the risks.</p>
<p class="calibre11">Severe allergic reactions following immunization with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have been reported in many countries. White House advisor Anthony Fauci <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/12/16/dr-anthony-fauci-with-meg-tirrell-for-special-edition-of-healthy-returns.html" target="_blank">told CNBC</a> in December that some adverse reactions are expected when a vaccine is distributed to a wider population. Regulators in the U.S. and U.K. have also released reports offering reassurances that severe reactions are rare.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Clinical trials status:</b> On November 18, Pfizer and BioNTech <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank">announced</a> the conclusion of their phase three trials. The trials <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-choose-lead-mrna-vaccine-candidate-0" target="_blank">launched in July</a>, enrolling a diverse population in areas with significant SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Pfizer has <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-propose-expansion-pivotal-covid-19" target="_blank">expanded the trial </a>to include 44,000 people across multiple countries.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On February 18, Pfizer and BioNTech <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-commence-global-clinical-trial-evaluate" target="_blank">announced</a> the launch of a phase two/three clinical trial to study the vaccine’s safety and efficacy among 4,000 pregnant women over the age of 18. The companies have also launched a phase 1/2/3 study in children between the ages of six months and 11 years.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On June 8, Pfizer <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-start-large-study-test-covid-19-vaccine-children-below-12-2021-06-08/" target="_blank">said</a> that it will expand its clinical trials to a larger group of children under age 12. After a phase one study showed that the vaccine was safe and effective in a group of 144 children, the clinical trials will now enroll up to 4,500 children at more than 90 sites in the U.S., Finland, Poland, and Spain. Pfizer will test a dose of 10 micrograms in children ages 5 to 11, and three micrograms for children from six months to five years old.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The company expects to have data for the older group in September and will likely file for emergency authorization for that group later that month. Data for children ages two to five will likely come soon afterward, while data for the youngest age group is not expected until October or November.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On July 8, Pfizer and Biotech <a href="https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/pfizer-and-biontech-provide-update-booster-program-light-delta" target="_blank">announced</a> that they are developing an updated version of the vaccine <a href="https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2021-07/Delta_Variant_Study_Press_Statement_Final_7.8.21.pdf?IPpR1xZjlwvaUMQ9sRn2FkePcBiRPGqw" target="_blank">that specifically targets the Delta variant</a>.

<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">What: </b>A viral vector vaccine that requires two doses.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Latest news:</b> A preprint study out of the United Kingdom shows that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines remain protective against the Delta variant <a href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/files/coronavirus/covid-19-infection-survey/finalfinalcombinedve20210816.pdf" target="_blank">but that their efficacy wanes over time</a>. Among study participants, Pfizer’s vaccine waned more rapidly. Within four to five months after a second dose, the vaccine’s efficacy was on par with the AstraZeneca shot. The study emphasizes, however, the both vaccines still significantly reduce the risk of infection.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Approval status:</b> Approved for use in the United Kingdom, the European Union, Argentina, India, and other countries.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Efficacy: </b>On July 8, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03777-9" target="_blank">a study published in <i class="calibre16">Nature</i></a> demonstrated that people who have received both doses of the AstraZeneca of Pfizer vaccines remain fully protected from the Delta and Beta variants. However, a single dose of either vaccine was not as protective.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On June 25, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3874014" target="_blank">preliminary results from a British study</a> showed that mixing doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines provides strong protection against COVID-19. Researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/health/mixing-pfizer-astrazeneca-results.html" target="_blank">told the <i class="calibre16">New York Times</i></a> that the protection is strong regardless of the order in which the vaccines are administered. The findings will be useful for those who are unable to get a second AstraZeneca vaccine due to production delays and safety concerns, although researchers say it’s still best to get two doses of the same vaccine for now.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On March 24, AstraZeneca <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html" target="_blank">released</a> the primary analysis of its U.S. phase three clinical trials showing that its vaccine is 76 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, slightly lower than the 79 percent efficacy it had announced two days earlier based on a partial analysis of the data. It is also 85 percent effective in people 65 and older and 100 percent effective at preventing severe cases of the disease.</p>
<p class="calibre11">U.S. health officials had taken the unusual step of <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/niaid-statement-astrazeneca-vaccine" target="_blank">questioning the decision to release the interim results</a>, describing them as “outdated and potentially misleading.” In a letter <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-concerns/2021/03/23/2f931d34-8bc3-11eb-a33e-da28941cb9ac_story.html" target="_blank">obtained by the Washington Post</a>, an independent panel of experts at the National Institutes of Health that oversees U.S. clinical trials said that it had recommended the company release a later analysis instead, showing the vaccine may be 69 to 74 percent effective.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On February 3, AstraZeneca and Oxford <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3777268" target="_blank">released a preprint study</a> of a phase three trial showing that their vaccine is 76-percent effective at preventing COVID-19 after one dose, with no severe cases or hospitalizations reported. The data also suggest that the vaccine may reduce asymptomatic transmission of the virus. Weekly swabs of participants testing for the presence of the virus found a 67-percent reduction in positive swabs after the first dose. </p>
<p class="calibre11">The companies <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-confirms-protection-against-severe-disease-hospitalisation-and-death-in-the-primary-analysis-of-phase-iii-trials.html#!" target="_blank">also said</a> that the vaccine’s efficacy increased to 82 percent when the second dose was taken after 12 weeks or longer, rather than the originally recommended four-week interval. The British government has recommended the longer gap in its rollout of the vaccine to prioritize getting the first shot to as many at-risk people as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre11">On February 7, South Africa <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/world/africa/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-south-africa.html" target="_blank">halted</a> its use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine after preliminary laboratory studies showed it offered only minimal protection against the virus variant that is dominant in that country. The finding was later confirmed by <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2102214" target="_blank">a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine</a> showing that the vaccine does not protect against mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 caused by the South African variant. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-vaccines-v/data-on-astrazeneca-vaccine-and-south-african-variant-should-come-soon-uk-expert-says-idUSKBN29I18P" target="_blank">Early data suggested </a>that the vaccine will still effectively protect against the variant that is prevalent throughout the U.K.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Safety:</b> On June 9, a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01408-4" target="_blank">published in the journal <i class="calibre16">Nature Medicine</i></a> found that people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine have a slightly increased risk of a bleeding disorder. The analysis of 2.53 million people who received the vaccine found an incidence of 1.13 cases per 100,000 vaccines. Researchers said the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh the risks. The study echoes and earlier <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood" target="_blank">safety review conducted by the European Medicines Agency</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre11">In Canada, meanwhile, on June 29 regulatory officials advised people with a history of capillary leak syndrome against receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. Health Canada i<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-heath-canada-adds-warning-of-very-rare-serious-condition-as-potential/" target="_blank">s also updating the vaccine’s label</a> to add the syndrome as a potential side effect.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Distribution:</b> Project members say their candidate can be stored at temperatures seen in common refrigeration. Oxford and AstraZeneca expect to produce up to three billion doses of the vaccine in 2021.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On December 30, the U.K. announced changes to its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oxford-universityastrazeneca-vaccine-authorised-by-uk-medicines-regulator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vaccine delivery plan</a>: With COVID-19 infections spreading rapidly, the country said it would prioritize delivering the first dose of either vaccine to as many at-risk people as possible, based on data <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948334/Information_for_UK_healthcare_professionals_on_COVID-19_Vaccine_AstraZeneca.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provided to and released by</a> health regulators.  It will do so by delaying administration of the second dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford drug. A similar rule was issued for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but regulators didn’t provide <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948338/jcvi-advice-on-priority-groups-for-covid-19-vaccination-30-dec-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data to back the new regimen</a>. Overall, the U.K. still recommends that recipients receive two doses of either vaccine for maximum benefit. </p>
<p class="calibre11">On February 15, the WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-02-2021-who-lists-two-additional-covid-19-vaccines-for-emergency-use-and-covax-roll-out" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listed</a> the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine for emergency use, which will allow the agency to begin rolling out the vaccine in low-income countries through the COVAX Facility.

<p class="calibre11">On April 26, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-business-government-and-politics-coronavirus-26fa41b98fab721218d9a51065351d9d" target="_blank">reported</a> that the U.S. plans to share its AstraZeneca vaccine stockpile with the rest of the world—up to 60 million doses. The U.S. has not yet authorized the company’s vaccine for use.</p>
<p class="calibre11">The European Union also said on April 26 that it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/world/europe/eu-astrazeneca-vaccine-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">suing AstraZeneca</a> over the delays in shipping hundreds of millions of doses of its vaccine. According to the New York Times, AstraZeneca has said it will only be able to deliver a third of the 300 million doses it had promised Europe by the end of June. The lawsuit will hinge on whether AstraZeneca can prove it has made its “best efforts” to deliver the doses on time, according to the terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="calibre11"><b class="calibre15">Clinical trials status:</b> On December 11, AstraZeneca and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/coronavirus-astrazeneca-to-work-on-vaccine-with-russias-gamaleya.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> plans to work together to study the possibility of combining Oxford’s vaccine with Gamaleya’s Sputnik V vaccine. Since both use the same adenovirus, researchers will investigate whether a combination of the two will improve efficacy. </p>
<p class="calibre11">The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine’s phase three trial aims to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers in Brazil, the U.K., the United States, and South Africa. On September 8, AstraZeneca paused the trials for a safety review due to an adverse reaction in one participant in the U.K., which the company described as a “routine action.” After an investigation by independent regulators, the trials <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/covid-19-vaccine-azd1222-clinical-trials-resumed-in-the-uk.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resumed</a> in the U.K., Brazil, South Africa, and India in September and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-trial-from-astrazeneca-oxford-can-resume-in-u-s-11603476923" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resumed in the U.S.</a> a month later.</p>

Merck will dedicate two facilities to producing the vaccine, which could double the amount of available doses. Biden said that the additional doses will allow the U.S. to vaccinate all adults by the end of May.</p>
<p class="calibre11">On June 11, the New York Times reported that the FDA <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/11/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-mask" target="_blank">has told</a> Johnson &amp; Johnson to throw out 60 million doses made at its plant in Baltimore.

The legal status in their state doesn’t prevent my father-in-law from using pot (their house reeks of it), but he at least keeps it in the house. Whenever they visit us however, he goes crazy smoking everywhere. Replace the joint with a flask, and he’d be called an alcoholic. I have tried everything to ask him not to do it around me—from the subtle hint, to asking my MIL to talk to him, to flat out telling him his behavior is making me very sick (multiple times)—and he has continued anyway, usually right before we get in a car and I’m trapped with it.

This is to protect my health.” Actually, it would be great if your husband could be the one to announce it. And he should give a reminder when the in-laws arrive. I know this might cause some tension, but let me reassure you that it’s not unreasonable at all. You can soften the blow by having some edibles ready for him when he shows up.

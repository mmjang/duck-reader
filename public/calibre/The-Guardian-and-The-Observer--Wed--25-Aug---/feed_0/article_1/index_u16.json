Here’s a summary of the day’s events as I hand over to my colleague Jessica Murray.</p> \n<p>Western nations today rushed to evacuate people from <a data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> as the 31 August deadline for the withdrawal of foreign troops drew closer and fears grew that many could be left behind to an uncertain fate under the country’s new Taliban rulers.</p> \n<p>In one of the biggest such airlifts ever, the United States and its allies have evacuated more than 70,000 people, including their citizens, NATO personnel and Afghans at risk, since 14 August, the day before the Taliban swept into the capital Kabul to bring to an end the 20-year foreign military presence. </p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>A group of 200 workers who guarded World Bank projects in <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> for the last 10 years until they lose their jobs last week have sent a desperate plea to the British government</strong> to rescue them urgently. </li> \n <li><strong>Two thousand Afghan interpreters and others who worked for the British government are still to be airlifted out of Kabu</strong>l by the RAF, defence sources said as the emergency evacuation reaches its final stages. </li> \n <li><strong>The UK foreign secretary has been urged to help evacuate<a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/25/scottish-charity-linda-norgrove-urges-raab-to-help-evacuate-two-afghan-aid-workers\"> two Afghan aid workers</a></strong><a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/25/scottish-charity-linda-norgrove-urges-raab-to-help-evacuate-two-afghan-aid-workers\"> employed by a Scottish charity</a> set up in the memory of the kidnapped aid worker Linda Norgrove. </li> \n <li><strong>France will end evacuation operations from <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> in the coming hours or days</strong> before the 31 August deadline, a government spokesman said. </li> \n <li><strong>The leader of a resistance movement to the Taliban has vowed to never surrender</strong> but is open to negotiations with the new rulers of <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a>, according to an interview published by Paris Match today. Ahmad Massoud has retreated to his native Panjshir valley north of Kabul along with former vice-president Amrullah Saleh.</li> \n <li><strong>Germany will keep evacuating people from <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> as long as it is responsible to do so</strong>, Chancellor Angela Merkel told conservative lawmakers, adding, however, that this is only possible with the United States.</li> \n <li><strong>Covid-19 vaccinations in <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> have dropped by 80%</strong>, the UN agency UNICEF said, warning that half of the few doses delivered to the country so far are close to expiry. </li> \n <li><strong>Afghanistan’s only boarding school for girls has<a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/aug/25/afghanistan-teachers-defend-girls-education-taliban-international-aid\"> temporarily relocated to Rwanda</a></strong><a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/aug/25/afghanistan-teachers-defend-girls-education-taliban-international-aid\">, its co-founder has said</a>, just days after a video of her burning class records to avoid Taliban recriminations was widely shared on social media. </li> \n <li><strong>A former Royal Marine who has been campaigning to have dozens of people and hundreds of animals at his sanctuary evacuated</strong> from Afghanistan <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/25/hope-ex-marine-rescue-cats-dogs-animals-kabul-paul-farthing\">has been offered a glimmer of hope</a> after the defence secretary said UK officials would help. </li> \n <li><strong>Dominic Raab said he is unclear how many people will be left behind in <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> once British troops withdraw by 31 August.</strong> The UK foreign secretary said the figure depends on “the window” left in terms of timing and how many people they manage to process over the next few days.</li> \n <li><strong>Raab has said 9,000 British nationals, Afghans who worked for British forces and those at risk, journalists and Chevening scholars have been evacuated from <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> since 15 August</strong>. Raab said this Taliban regime needs to be more “inclusive” and “moderate” compared to the previous Taliban.</li> \n <li><strong>Two members of Congress flew unannounced into Kabul airport in the middle of the ongoing chaotic evacuation Tuesday,</strong> stunning State Department and US military personnel who had to divert resources to provide security and information to the lawmakers, US officials said.<br></li> \n <li><strong>Spain will not be able to rescue all Afghans who served alongside its troops in Afghanistan because of the “dramatic” situation on the ground,</strong> Defence Minister Margarita Robles said on Tuesday. Robles said Taliban checkpoints and violence were making it difficult for people to reach Kabul airport to catch one of Spain’s daily military flights out of Afghanistan.</li> \n <li><strong>Joe Biden has rejected the pleas of domestic and international allies to keep troops in <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> for evacuation efforts beyond 31 August</strong>, citing the growing threat of a terrorist attack.</li> \n <li><strong>Reports are filtering in that the United States <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/aug/24/afghanistan-live-news-taliban-kabul-us-withdrawal-joe-biden-germany-airport-plane-flights-evacuation?page=with:block-61254f8a8f08b1506f20db3d#block-61254f8a8f08b1506f20db3d\">has started</a> to take some of the 6,000 troops it has in <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> out of the country,</strong> as it accelerates evacuations.

However, he added, “we will likely need to anticipate a few hours, maybe a few days ahead” of the American forces’ departure from Kabul airport.</p> \n<p>“We will continue as long as possible,” he said. “Due to extreme tension on the ground ... and the scheduled departure of American forces, these evacuations are a true race against time.”</p> \n<p>Attal declined to elaborate on how many people are still waiting for evacuation by France in Kabul. A 10th flight carrying evacuees landed in Paris on Wednesday, with 21 French and 220 Afghan nationals, including 130 children onboard, according to the French Office of Immigration and Integration.</p> \n<p>In total, at least 1,720 Afghans and 100 French people have been evacuated by France since the beginning of the operation last week. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, promised France would evacuate Afghans who worked for the country as well as activists and others under threat.</p>\n        </div>\n        \n        <p>Updated\n            <time datetime=\"2021-08-25T13:12:22.000Z\">at 2.12pm BST</time>\n        </p>\n        \n        \n\n\n\n    </div>\n\n    <div data-sort-time=\"1629894169000\" id=\"block-612635f28f080ef844e7527b\" itemprop=\"liveBlogUpdate\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/BlogPosting\">\n\n        \n\n        <p>\n                <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/aug/25/afghanistan-live-news-taliban-kabul-joe-biden-firm-31-august-deadline-us-troops-latest-updates?page=with:block-612635f28f080ef844e7527b#block-612635f28f080ef844e7527b\" itemprop=\"url\">\n                    \n\n    <time data-relativeformat=\"med\" datetime=\"2021-08-25T12:22:49.000Z\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">1.22pm <span>BST</span></time>\n    <span>13:22</span>\n\n\n\n                </a>\n        </p>\n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                <div>\n    \n        \n            <p><img alt=\"Severin Carrell\" src=\"/calibre/The-Guardian-and-The-Observer--Wed--25-Aug---/feed_0/article_1/images/img8_u5.jpg\"></p><p itemprop=\"author\">Severin Carrell</p>\n</div>\n\n            \n        \n\n        <div itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n        <p>The UK foreign secretary has been urged to help evacuate two Afghan aid workers employed by a Scottish charity set up in the memory of the kidnapped aid worker Linda Norgrove.</p> \n<p>Norgrove was killed during an attempted rescue by US special forces after she was kidnapped in Afghanistan in 2010.

Here’s a summary of the day’s events as I hand over to my colleague Jessica Murray. \nWestern nations today rushed to evacuate people from Afghanistan as the 31 August deadline for the withdrawal of foreign troops drew closer and fears grew that many could be left behind to an uncertain fate under the country’s new Taliban rulers. \nIn one of the biggest such airlifts ever, the United States and its allies have evacuated more than 70,000 people, including their citizens, NATO personnel and Afghans at risk, since 14 August, the day before the Taliban swept into the capital Kabul to bring to an end the 20-year foreign military presence.  \n \n A group of 200 workers who guarded World Bank projects in Afghanistan for the last 10 years until they lose their jobs last week have sent a desperate plea to the British government to rescue them urgently.  \n Two thousand Afghan interpreters and others who worked for the British government are still to be airlifted out of Kabul by the RAF, defence sources said as the emergency evacuation reaches its final stages.  \n The UK foreign secretary has been urged to help evacuate two Afghan aid workers employed by a Scottish charity set up in the memory of the kidnapped aid worker Linda Norgrove.  \n France will end evacuation operations from Afghanistan in the coming hours or days before the 31 August deadline, a government spokesman said.  \n The leader of a resistance movement to the Taliban has vowed to never surrender but is open to negotiations with the new rulers of Afghanistan, according to an interview published by Paris Match today. Ahmad Massoud has retreated to his native Panjshir valley north of Kabul along with former vice-president Amrullah Saleh. \n Germany will keep evacuating people from Afghanistan as long as it is responsible to do so, Chancellor Angela Merkel told conservative lawmakers, adding, however, that this is only possible with the United States. \n Covid-19 vaccinations in Afghanistan have dropped by 80%, the UN agency UNICEF said, warning that half of the few doses delivered to the country so far are close to expiry.  \n Afghanistan’s only boarding school for girls has temporarily relocated to Rwanda, its co-founder has said, just days after a video of her burning class records to avoid Taliban recriminations was widely shared on social media.  \n A former Royal Marine who has been campaigning to have dozens of people and hundreds of animals at his sanctuary evacuated from Afghanistan has been offered a glimmer of hope after the defence secretary said UK officials would help.  \n Dominic Raab said he is unclear how many people will be left behind in Afghanistan once British troops withdraw by 31 August. The UK foreign secretary said the figure depends on “the window” left in terms of timing and how many people they manage to process over the next few days. \n Raab has said 9,000 British nationals, Afghans who worked for British forces and those at risk, journalists and Chevening scholars have been evacuated from Afghanistan since 15 August. Raab said this Taliban regime needs to be more “inclusive” and “moderate” compared to the previous Taliban. \n Two members of Congress flew unannounced into Kabul airport in the middle of the ongoing chaotic evacuation Tuesday, stunning State Department and US military personnel who had to divert resources to provide security and information to the lawmakers, US officials said. \n Spain will not be able to rescue all Afghans who served alongside its troops in Afghanistan because of the “dramatic” situation on the ground, Defence Minister Margarita Robles said on Tuesday. Robles said Taliban checkpoints and violence were making it difficult for people to reach Kabul airport to catch one of Spain’s daily military flights out of Afghanistan. \n Joe Biden has rejected the pleas of domestic and international allies to keep troops in Afghanistan for evacuation efforts beyond 31 August, citing the growing threat of a terrorist attack. \n Reports are filtering in that the United States has started to take some of the 6,000 troops it has in Afghanistan out of the country, as it accelerates evacuations. The US president did not take any questions after his White House remarks, and did not mention this point. Moments earlier, the White House press secretary had declined to discuss it at the media briefing. \n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    2.53pm BST\n    14:53\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n        Mexico received 124 media workers and their family members from Afghanistan, including New York Times journalists, the government said on Wednesday, as people flee after the Taliban militant group’s takeover. \nThey arrived at Mexico City’s international airport early on Wednesday morning, where the country’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, waited to greet them. \nHe said: \n  \n  \n     \n Mexico has decided to support human rights applications for refuge, asylum and humanitarian visas for people in Afghanistan who have asked to have this humanitarian condition.  \n \nA day earlier, five members of Afghanistan’s all-girls robotics team arrived in Mexico.Mexico has pledged to aid Afghan women and girls amid concern about their treatment under Taliban rule. Ebrard said on 18 August that the country was processing refugee applications of Afghan citizens, especially women and girls, with the aid of Guillermo Puente Ordorica, Mexico’s ambassador in Iran. \nEbrard helped to quickly arrange the journalists’ departure from Kabul, which included a stopover in Qatar, before their eventual arrival to Mexico, according to the New York Times. \nReuters evacuated a group of 73 people made up of its workers and their families to Pakistan from Afghanistan on Monday. \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n  \n  \n     Marcelo Ebrard, the Mexican secretary of foreign affairs, speaks during a press conference in Mexico City to welcome a group of journalists living in Afghanistan who received humanitarian asylum together with their families.

However, he added, “we will likely need to anticipate a few hours, maybe a few days ahead” of the American forces’ departure from Kabul airport. \n“We will continue as long as possible,” he said. “Due to extreme tension on the ground ... and the scheduled departure of American forces, these evacuations are a true race against time.” \nAttal declined to elaborate on how many people are still waiting for evacuation by France in Kabul. A 10th flight carrying evacuees landed in Paris on Wednesday, with 21 French and 220 Afghan nationals, including 130 children onboard, according to the French Office of Immigration and Integration. \nIn total, at least 1,720 Afghans and 100 French people have been evacuated by France since the beginning of the operation last week. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, promised France would evacuate Afghans who worked for the country as well as activists and others under threat.\n        \n        \n        Updated\n            at 2.12pm BST\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    1.22pm BST\n    13:22\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            Severin Carrell\n\n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        The UK foreign secretary has been urged to help evacuate two Afghan aid workers employed by a Scottish charity set up in the memory of the kidnapped aid worker Linda Norgrove. \nNorgrove was killed during an attempted rescue by US special forces after she was kidnapped in Afghanistan in 2010. Her parents, Lorna and John Norgrove, set up a foundation in her name which has since helped secure scholarships for 200 Afghan women, 100 of whom are training to be doctors. \nThe couple have asked for urgent assistance to help evacuate the foundation’s two female employees, who are sisters, one of whom has a husband and infant child. They are Hazara, an ethnic minority that emphasises education for girls which has been persecuted by the Taliban. \n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    1.19pm BST\n    13:19\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n            France set to end Afghanistan evacuations in coming hours or days\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n        France will end evacuation operations from Afghanistan in the coming hours or days before the 31 August deadline, a government spokesman said on Wednesday. \nHowever, the spokesman could not set a precise deadline as to when its Afghanistan evacuations would end as the deadline for the withdrawal of foreign troops drew closer with no sign that the Taliban might allow an extension.\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    1.07pm BST\n    13:07\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            Andrew Roth\n\n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        The Taliban have captured more than 100 Russian-made helicopters in various states of operability, the head of a Russian state arms exporter has said, but will be largely unable to use them with little access to maintenance crews and spare parts. \nAs the Taliban overran the Afghan army and took control of large stores of arms and vehicles, it also captured at least 100 Mi-17 Hip helicopters, a Russian-made transport aircraft procured by the US for the Afghan armed forces because it was comparatively cheaper and easier to fly than US-made UH-60 Black Hawks. \n“The helicopter fleet there is large – more than 100 Mi-17 helicopters of various types,” said Alexander Mikheev, the head of the Russian state exporter Rosoboronexporter, according to the Interfax news agency. “Of course, this fleet requires repair, maintenance and spare parts supply.” A large portion of the fleet could already be grounded, he said. \n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    1.00pm BST\n    13:00\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                \n    \n        \n            Lorenzo Tondo\n\n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        Italy’s prime minister Mario Draghi has urged G7 leaders to redirect funds destined for Afghan military forces towards humanitarian aid. \n“Italy will redirect those resources that were destined for military forces in Afghanistan towards humanitarian aid and I ask you all to join this commitment, compatibly with the situation of your countries,” according to sources present at the virtual summit, Italy’s news agency Ansa has reported. \nAccording to Milex, Italy’s independent monitoring project focusing on military spending, Italy has spent €8.7bn since 2001 during its mission in Afghanistan. \nDraghi stressed the need to “maintain a contact channel even after the 31 August deadline and the possibility of transiting from Afghanistan in a safe way’’. \n“Furthermore”, he added, “we must ensure that international organisations have access to Afghanistan also after this deadline”. \nItaly’s PM also urged the G7 to involve Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and India. \nOn Wednesday, Defence Minister Lorenzo Guerini said some 3,741 Afghans have been evacuated from Kabul, on 44 flights, and 2,659 of them are already in Italy. \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    12.45pm BST\n    12:45\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n        Hungary’s evacuation efforts from Afghanistan are nearing an end after 500 people were airlifted from Kabul, the country’s foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said on Wednesday. \n“The exact timing will be announced by the commander of the army, which may happen as soon as today,” Szijjarto said, adding that most evacuees were Afghan nationals who had supported a Hungarian charity or Hungarian troops there. \nA plane carrying 240 Afghan nationals including 126 children landed in Budapest on Wednesday.

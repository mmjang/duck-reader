It’s sort of like ‘make a comfy space on your sofa and sit with us’.”</p><p>A comfy space on the sofa seems like an unlikely listening space for a label that began as an outlet for avant garde improvisation 15 years ago but, says Reynell, it makes total sense given how his attitudes to contemporary classical music have changed in that time.</p><p>“I grew up in the 70s listening to avant garde improvisation,” says Reynell, “Free atonality, distorting the note. But then in the 90s I got bored of it. <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/nov/12/morton-feldman-contemporary-music-guide\">Morton Feldman</a>, <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/nov/26/luigi-nono-contemporary-music-guide\">Luigi Nono</a>’s late music and British artists such as <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Crane\">Laurence Crane</a> drew me to a gentler kind of experimental music, an emphasis on quiet and minimalistic improvisation.”</p><p>“The new music scene of the 80s was very macho,” says Crane, “certainly in the UK. Someone like me working with common chords and pared-down textures had to accept that we had less access to funding or high-profile performances. Most people considered “new music” to be mainstream modernism, fast changing, fleeting, glittery and goal-directed. Mentioning no names, a number of the London publishing houses were weighted towards male composers writing in that style and what I found irksome then was the unequal distribution of resources, with some stylistic positions being heavily favoured over others.”</p><p>Crane says the scene today is far more inclusive and diverse. “That uniformity eroded,” he says, “and the internet has had a big role to play in allowing composers to release their music free from publishing houses. Another Timbre emerged from this stylistic openness [and] has contributed greatly to setting some sort of new agenda. There’s no doubt Reynell’s CDs of music by composers such as Jurg Frey, Martin Arnold and Linda Catlin Smith have been crucial in introducing this music to wider audiences and younger composers.”</p><p>Based out of Toronto since the early 80s, Canadian composer <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://www.catlinsmith.com/\">Linda Catlin Smith</a>, who’s had <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/16/linda-catlin-smith-drifter-cd-review-apartment-house-bozzini-quartet-another-timbre\">five CDs of her music released on Another Timbre,</a> says she was “born too late” for the ultra-modernism of <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/06/elliott-carter-remembered\">Elliott Carter</a> and the minimalism of Steve Reich so was instead drawn to the immersive ambiguous transparency of Feldman and late Cage.</p><p>“I reacted against all that active, intense, dramatic music,” she explains, “With Cage’s Number Pieces and with Feldman I felt drawn into a world where I could hear everything that was happening.”</p><p>It’s a philosophy she extends to her own slow, graceful spectral music, and the recordings of it by Apartment House for Another Timbre.</p><p>“Apartment House get it,” she says. “When I hear them play my music I feel I’ve learned something. The piece might be written by me but the performance is authored by the players. It’s deep collaboration. And there is a listenership out there for it that’s really huge. We’re living in a time of great plurality.

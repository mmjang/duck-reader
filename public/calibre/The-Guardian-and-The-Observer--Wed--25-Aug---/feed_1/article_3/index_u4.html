But not to those who know her determination and fearlessness.</span></p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Some say Graham, 51, was written off because she was a woman. Her refusal to bow to pressure to stand down to make way for a leftwing unity candidate, Steve Turner, who was judged most likely to ensure the defeat of the Keir Starmer-supporting Gerard Coyne, earned her “disgraceful” online opprobrium, some of which was unquestionably misogynistic.</p><p id="sign-in-gate" class="dcr-vdb1rb"></p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The ensuing row left her fearing for her job as head of Unite’s organising, or “leverage”, department, its industrial action wing. <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/27/female-candidate-to-lead-unite-union-faced-disgraceful-abuse">Trolls posted insults</a> including mocked-up pictures of her as Margaret Thatcher. “If you’re a woman in a leadership role, it’s all the usual sexist stuff that you hear. It will never deter me. Maybe they’re a bit worried I might win,” she said recently.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">And win she did, against expectations. Her campaign message – “It’s Westminster versus the workplace: back to the workplace” – cut through to grassroots members of a union that remains one of the <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> party’s biggest funders.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Backed by the Socialist Workers party and the Socialist party, her triumph over the Communist party-backed Turner, who was assistant general secretary and McCluskey’s choice as successor, vindicated her toughness and judgment in refusing to withdraw, said insiders.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“The boys underestimated her at their peril,” said one.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Graham, a mother of one, was born and raised in Hammersmith, west London, one of four children to an Irish mother and a father from Newcastle upon Tyne, who met while working in the hotel industry. As a child, her mother said, she demonstrated fierce determination in almost always beating her siblings in the daily breakfast table battle to claim the cream from the pint of milk.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">After attending the local comprehensive in Hammersmith, she left aged 16 to begin several years working in the hospitality industry, starting as a silver service waitress. She led her first successful walkout aged 17, during an unofficial strike to defend the rights of casual workers.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">From that moment she understood the power of the collective and how unions could help change people’s lives for the better, she said. “I’ll never forget that. I was 17. How I got away with it I don’t know but I did. You can’t persuade employers just by the weight of argument. The restaurant owner ignored us for months but did a deal after the walkout.”</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Aged 27, she attended the TUC Organising Academy, and for the past 20 years she has worked for what is now <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/unite">Unite</a>, first at the Transport and General Workers’ Union before it merged with Amicus to become Unite.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">She has built a reputation as an experienced and highly skilled negotiator, and as head of Unite’s organising department is credited with 15 major victories, often using strategies that go beyond the traditional approach. During last year’s <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/17/ba-begins-to-carry-out-its-fire-and-rehire-threat-to-jobs">“fire and rehire” dispute</a> with British Airways, for example, MPs were asked to support motions against the airline’s tactics, followed by warnings to its owner International Airlines Group, that it could lose landing slots at Heathrow.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">She has Amazon in her sights, setting up a hotline for its workers. “These workers need a union to defend their rights,” she said.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">She is also working on some of the first collective bargaining home-working agreements, with particular focus on the impact on women. “I was home working and part going-out and my little one was home schooling. Actually the burden often does fall on women, we’re juggling all of these things around,” she said recently.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Her campaign material says she specialises in hostile campaigns and “has won every campaign she has led – 100% track record”. These included illegal closures, victimisation of union leaders and the preservation of national wage bargaining.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Her motivation, she has said, is “simple beliefs” that trade unions exist to fight bad employers, and building the strength of the union in the workplace. The fight for jobs, pay and conditions is, she says, what it says “on the union tin”.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Her victory could have ramifications for Labour. The union pays £1.3m in affiliation fees and before the 2019 general election donated £3m to the party. She has said there will be “no blank cheque” for Labour and any payments must be on results.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Her clear message is that with the trade union movement on “life support”, Unite needs to focus on representing workers and end an obsession with Labour’s internal wranglings.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“Our members need to see action for their money and my political work will extend far beyond the confines of Westminster parlour games,” she has said.<br class="calibre8"/></p></div></div></main></main></div></div></div></div><div class="calibre_navbar">

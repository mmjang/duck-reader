Set at the height of the 1980s “video nasties” moral panic, the film adopts and adapts the genre of gory horror it depicts, by focusing on a character still grieving for her long-lost sister.</span></p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The plaudits for the film have so far failed to translate into significant box office receipts, however – aligning the film with other recent acclaimed British debuts such as Ben Sharrock’s <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/11/limbo-review-ben-sharrock">Limbo</a> and Aleem Khan’s<a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/04/after-love-director-aleem-khan-i-walked-around-mecca-and-prayed-not-to-be-gay"> After Love</a>.

The same goes for Ari Aster, currently on his third film after releasing <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/01/hereditary-review-horror-toni-collette-brilliant-fear">Hereditary</a> as his debut in 2018. Some exceptions remain: Francis Lee’s <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/ammonite">Ammonite</a>, his follow-up to God’s Own Country, came out last year, and Michael Pearce, director of <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/27/how-michael-pearce-went-from-chugger-to-director-of-serial-killer-thriller-beast">Beast</a> (2017), has a second effort in the offing. But there does seem to be a trend for uncovering new talent in the UK, and failing to support it further than its first steps.</p><div class="calibre8" id="e1751a7b-c46b-4ac3-9f93-d616d54696fc"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="Morfydd Clark in Saint Maud." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img3_u15.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>Hype doesn’t always turn into lasting success ... Morfydd Clark in Saint Maud.</span> Photograph: Courtesy of A24 Films/AP</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Why? What needs to change for UK cinema to support young film-makers? First off, it seems likely that a repeated pattern of wild industry excitement and exaggerated critical acclaim for the debut efforts of young directors could be detrimental to their careers rather than beneficial. Few directors create hits on their first tilt – Censor is no exception – so directors need cautious optimism and constructive criticism, in order to hone and develop their technique, which can only improve with age.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">It’s understandable that the critical establishment might lavish praise on new voices, since the UK film industry is clearly lacking in depth compared to, say, France, Italy, Poland or Romania. But audiences, who are needed for word of mouth, won’t keep shelling out for what they have been promised is a masterpiece if it always turns out to be, instead, the promising but still somewhat jejune effort of a talented newbie. Meanwhile, creatives need two things: artistic freedom, and support from within the industry in the form of awards and hard cash.</p><div class="calibre8" id="961d7d38-935f-46f2-bf7b-5771b013e716"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="Rungano Nyoni’s 2017 debut, I Am Not a Witch, received huge critical acclaim but she has yet to make a second film." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img4_u12.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>Rungano Nyoni’s 2017 debut, I Am Not a Witch, received huge critical acclaim but she has yet to make a second film.</span> Photograph: Allstar/FILM4</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">There are some signs of positivity. Thankfully, after many desperate years in the wilderness, Bafta made <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/24/bafta-tries-to-increase-diversity-with-120-changes-to-its-awards">significant changes</a> to its voting and membership processes last year, resulting in an awards ceremony with a slightly different flavour than previous years, when the awards kowtowed too readily to US cinema. The prizes given out this year still ended up going to mostly big names, but nominated alongside Frances McDormand in the best actress category were British actors <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/08/rocks-sarah-gavron-interview-film-bukky-bakray-kosar-ali">Bukky Bakray (Rocks)</a> and <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/his-house-review-effective-haunted-house-horror-with-timely-spin">Wunmi Mosaku (His House)</a>. There is still progress to be made, of course, but the publicity and recognition of creatives are needed to sustain a deep field of talent.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The UK suffers from sharing a language with the US, Canada and Australia, meaning that competition for anglophone audiences is fierce: other countries, perhaps, have the luxury of being able to play to a more captive audience seeking films in its own tongue. British talent has long drifted to the US for greater financial gain and more diverse opportunities, from directors such as Sam Mendes and Christopher Nolan to actors such as Daniel Kaluuya or Riz Ahmed. This means that the UK is always playing catch-up, and piggybacking our own talent for box office results once they have acquired clout from the US. Steve McQueen is one such a name – a director who can now command his own projects, off the back of US investment, prizes and renown.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Cuts to British arts organisations and funding have not helped matters, and cinema has been further depleted by the rise of TV streaming – but the industry has talent to spare, which, with careful and measured nurture, could still rebuild into something solid.</p></div></div></main></main></div></div></div></div><div class="calibre_navbar">

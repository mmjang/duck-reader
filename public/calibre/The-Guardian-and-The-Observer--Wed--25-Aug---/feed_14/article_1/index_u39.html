How are we all feeling? Thanks for sticking with these emails.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">I’ve been jokingly calling this the intercalated email because it isn’t quite the Olympics and it isn’t quite the Paralympics. In 1906 they got over-excited and following 1896, 1900 and 1904 decided to hold another Olympics in Athens in 1906. The aim then was to hold the Games every two years – once internationally, then back to Athens, then internationally, then back to Athens and so on. Clearly impractical, and those 1906 Games in Athens have been shoved aside in Olympics history, and named the “Intercalated Games”. Like this email.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">But I wanted to drop in to your inbox to remind you that we’ll be back next week when the Paralympics starts. At Rio, in 2016, Team GB’s 15-year-old <strong class="calibre12">Ellie Robinson</strong> <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/paralympic-games-eight-golden-team-gb-moments-games-rio">set a world record in the 50m butterfly</a> and said “It’s going to be weird to go back to school as a Paralympic champion.”</p><div class="calibre8" id="981cf6c7-a01f-42b4-a23e-3ecb66d5e11f"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="Ellie Robinson competes in the Women’s 50m Butterfly S6 Final in Rio." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img4_u3.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>Ellie Robinson competes in the Women’s 50m Butterfly S6 Final in Rio.</span> Photograph: Bob Martin for OIS/PA</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">In the cycling in Rio, <strong class="calibre12">Kadeena Cox</strong> became the first British Paralympian to <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/kadeena-cox-gb-paralympics-rio-athletics-gold">win medals in two sports</a> in the same Games since 1988.

Badminton and taekwondo replace sailing and 7-a-side football, but overall there will be 540 events in 22 sports. Like the Olympics, all fans will be barred because of the coronavirus pandemic, organisers confirmed on Monday.</p><div class="calibre8" id="b277198d-fe1d-4a31-95a4-21c46d72a39e"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="Olympic bronze medal skateboarder Sky Brown leaving Tokyo airport." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img7_u12.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>Olympic bronze medal skateboarder Sky Brown leaving Tokyo airport.</span> Photograph: Jun Sato/GC Images</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">While looking ahead to the Paralympics, I’ve also still been thinking about how enjoyable the Olympics were. I’ve thought especially about how lovely it was to share the experience some of the athletes returning home and being greeted by their families. For some it was the joy of seeing their children again. For others, given the introduction of sports like skateboarding into the Games, it was the children who were coming home. With the medals.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">And I especially keep thinking about that handover segment in the Olympic closing ceremony looking ahead to Paris 2024, and featuring French medal winners who had already left Japan and so were able to celebrate their success surrounded by fans, when in Tokyo there was an empty stadium.</p><div class="calibre8" id="04f7c845-2129-4732-8540-8cbcf3e6d9bf"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="The party in Paris as they get ready for their Olympics." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img8_u12.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>The party in Paris as they get ready for their Olympics.</span> Photograph: Aurélien Meunier/Getty Images</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">In his closing speech at the Olympics IOC president Thomas Bach praised Japan because nobody before had ever tried to put on a postponed Games. And they now face the task again with a postponed Paralympics. I’m sure it is going to shine.</p><h2 class="block-title"><strong class="calibre15">Things you might have missed …</strong></h2><ul class="calibre_feed_list">

On the whole I thought it was mostly a light-hearted and fun ceremony to open up the Paralympics. Those of us of a certain vintage will have appreciated the bit when the DJ went completely late-80s/early 90s acid house on us all during the athlete’s parade. And they definitely doubled-down on attention to detail on the airport theme, with some of the dancers even wearing hats with little rotating propellers on them.</p><div class="calibre8" id="e2fad255-d026-448b-902e-331a3b09bdee"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="One of the propellor-headed performers at the opening ceremony." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img3_u27.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>One of the propeller-headed performers at the opening ceremony.</span> Photograph: Buda Mendes/Getty Images</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">There were sombre moments though. Reflections on the year that has just gone, and the loss of life from Covid-19 that led to the Games being delayed. And there was also the recognition that the Afghanistan Paralympics team are not in Tokyo – but their flag was carried in a symbolic gesture.</p><div class="calibre8" id="8049aabc-15c5-4aea-a226-c78462e651fa"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="A Paralympic volunteer carries the national flag of Afghanistan during the opening ceremonies." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img4_u34.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>A Paralympic volunteer carries the national flag of Afghanistan during the opening ceremonies.</span> Photograph: Joel Marklund for OIS/AP</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">New Zealand were also curiously only represented by their national flag – their athletes all decided to stay away from the stadium. Malaysia probably took the costume award for their modern twist on their traditional national dress, although there were strong efforts from Mexico and South Africa too.</p><div class="calibre8" id="1197cf2e-fb4d-49ab-ae9d-52857190f3c4"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="Members of team Malaysia walk in the parade of athletes." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img5_u14.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>Members of team Malaysia walk in the parade of athletes.</span> Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty Images</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The International Paralympics Committee (IPC) president, <strong class="calibre12">Andrew Parsons,</strong> said “I cannot believe we are finally here.

They gave no name or details and said the athlete was now in isolation.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Meanwhile, the IPC has faced some criticism in the UK, with suggestions that it offers limited opportunities to athletes with learning disabilities. The Mencap charity says athletes with such a disability can only compete for 4% of the gold medals available at the Games.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The Mencap chief executive, Edel Harris, said: “The Paralympics is about inclusion and it’s important that everyone is included and not left out. I feel that this is discrimination. Why is it – when we are constantly talking about the need for greater inclusion – that people with a learning disability are still excluded from so much at the Paralympics?”</p><h2 class="block-title"><strong class="calibre15">You might also enjoy reading …</strong></h2><ul class="calibre_feed_list">

Reid wasn’t going to the opening ceremony today as she’s competing at the weekend and “you’re standing for almost seven hours”.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">But she said that despite her fears that the atmosphere at the Games might be rather “sterile”, organisers have gone to great lengths to make the athletes feel at home. “The volunteers that we do see are finding different ways to make us feel supported,” she said. “All around the track where we train we have these personalised messages of good luck and notes from school kids, and they’re cheering as the competitors come in, and that has actually felt really welcoming and really fun.”</p><div class="calibre8" id="140a59a1-c4d0-4496-868f-b3ed29561cbe"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="Stef Reid in action competing in London in 2019 before Covid intervened." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img8_u7.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>Stef Reid competing in London in 2019 before Covid-19 caused the Tokyo Games to be delayed.</span> Photograph: Paul Harding/PA Archive/PA Images</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Reid offered a positive message about what this year’s Paralympics could achieve. “I think it’s been a really hard year for everybody, not just athletes.

And just a reminder that you can still do great things, even in hard times, even if you have to do them a little bit differently.

In Uganda, there are very few people who have disabilities who want to come out and be themselves. I can also show other young people, who want to participate in Para sports, that they should go forward and believe in themselves.

Three more track cycling finals follow, including the C5 3,000m individual pursuit where Britain’s most successful female Paralympian, 43-year-old <strong class="calibre12">Sarah Storey</strong>, will be hoping to add to her tally of 14 Paralympic gold medals 🥇</p><ul class="calibre_feed_list">

The sport started as a rehabilitation treatment for second world war veterans who had been blinded, and is now played in more than 80 countries.

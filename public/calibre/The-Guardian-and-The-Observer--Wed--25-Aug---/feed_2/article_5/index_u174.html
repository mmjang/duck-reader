<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">This comes as the latest National records of Scotland data showed 41 deaths registered over the last week to August 22 where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate. <br class="calibre8"/></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">This was a record high in cases for the second day running, as deputy first minister John Swinney suggested that the surge in cases was related to pupils returning to school after the summer holidays.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">He said that data showed around a third of new cases were in the under-19s age group, where around 40% of 16 and 17 year olds have had their first vaccine dose.</p>

 <div class="calibre8">
  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Cases have risen very significantly within Scotland and we are looking closely at why that is the case.

        <div class="calibre8" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Military troops must immediately begin to get vaccinated against Covid after Pfizer’s jab received full approval, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said in a memo as he ordered service leaders to “impose ambitious timelines for implementation”.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">More than 800,000 service members out of 2.1 million, including reserves, have yet to get inoculated, according to Pentagon data. The memo, which was obtained by the Associated Press, does not dictate a specific timeline for completing the vaccinations. </p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“To defend this nation, we need a healthy and ready force,” Austin said in the memo. “After careful consultation with medical experts and military leadership, and with the support of the president, I have determined that mandatory vaccination against coronavirus disease … is necessary to protect the force and defend the American people.”<br tabindex="-1" class="calibre8"/></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Troops will be able to get their Pfizer shots at their bases and from their commands around the world, the AP reports. The Pentagon has said it has enough vaccine supply to meet demand. </p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Members of the US military are already required to get as many as 17 different vaccines, depending on where they are deployed. The requirements – which include shots for smallpox, hepatitis, polio and the flu – also provide for a number of temporary and permanent exemptions for either medical or administrative reasons, the AP reports.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Austin in the memo noted that the new requirement will allow for exemptions that are consistent with the current policies for all the other vaccines. Permanent exemptions include serious medical reactions to the vaccine, immune deficiencies such as HIV infection, and “evidence of existing immunity” by a serologic antibody test or “documentation of previous infection or natural infection presumed.”<br class="calibre8"/><br class="calibre8"/>A little over half of the US population is fully vaccinated with one of the country’s three options – Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson.<br tabindex="-1" class="calibre8"/></p>

        <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">On the topic of long-term public health action, experts have said recently that the evidence linking obesity to the worst Covid-19 outcomes is “overwhelmingly clear” and should warrant aggressive obesity prevention and management efforts. </p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Jonathan Valabhji, the national clinical director for obesity and diabetes at NHS England, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/aug/20/coronavirus-live-news-israel-to-start-booster-shots-for-over-40s-3000-fake-vaccination-cards-seized-in-alaska?page=with:block-611fcdb18f08cc0d8b00496c#block-611fcdb18f08cc0d8b00496c">suggested that pandemic restrictions</a> are actually worsening obesity levels. </p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">With co-author Dr Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, he wrote that evidence suggests the link between body mass index (BMI) and Covid-related mortality is stronger than for deaths from other causes, including other respiratory illnesses.</p> 
<blockquote class="quoted">  
 <span> 
   </span>  
 <div class="calibre8">
  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">It is therefore important that health systems around the world meet this challenge by upscaling emphasis on and investments in obesity prevention and treatments.</p>
  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Recent successful interventions in weight management need to be extended and offered to many more people at risk. New, simpler, innovative ways to spread evidence-based dietary or activity messages should also be examined as many people with risk factors are not currently receiving advice. If ever there was a time to improve obesity prevention and management, it is now.</p>

<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Sales at McDonald’s, perhaps the best-known fast food chain, in the US have jumped nearly 15% on 2019 despite obesity being a leading Covid risk factor. McDonald’s <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/17/tom-watson-urges-mcdonalds-cancel-unhealthy-campaign-promotion">has previously been accused of endangering public health</a> in the UK by encouraging customers to eat more fast food in exchange for prizes such as fries, desserts and fizzy drinks.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">About 2.2m of the 2.5m deaths related to Covid over a period studied were in countries with high levels of overweight people, a report from the World Obesity Federation has found. Countries such as the US, UK, and Italy, where more than 50% of adults are overweight, have the biggest proportions of deaths linked to coronavirus.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The US experienced a 29% jump in diabetes deaths last year among people ages 25 to 44 during the pandemic, with the country’s Preventive Services Task Force’s issuing new guidance yesterday to screen people for the condition earlier <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/aug/24/coronavirus-live-news-hawaii-governor-wants-to-curb-travel-israel-boosters-beating-delta?page=with:block-6125161e8f08b1506f20d840#block-6125161e8f08b1506f20d840">due to the spike</a>.

        <p class="dcr-vdb1rb"><strong class="calibre12">The emergence of the Delta variant means that vaccination may not prove to be the magic bullet that many governments hoped for, a new report by the Economist Intelligence Unit has said.</strong></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">It called on political leaders to rethink their Covid strategy to adapt it for the long term, after the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group said reaching herd immunity was “not a possibility” with the current Delta variant and represented “mythical” thinking.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The report also modelled that countries that have not have vaccinated 60% of their population by mid-2022 would register GDP losses totalling US$2.3trn in 2022-25. It warned of the geopolitical consequences of vaccine inequity as less developed countries would shoulder around two-thirds of these losses, with Covax having “failed” to reach even modest expectations.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">It also said that China’s vaccine diplomacy operation had been a success, though it comes with risks for recipient countries, since the efficacy of some Chinese vaccines appears generally lower than that of Western jabs. </p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Agathe Demarais, the EIU’s global forecasting director and author of the report, said:<br class="calibre8"/></p> 
<blockquote class="quoted">

 <div class="calibre8">
  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">In absolute terms, Asia will be the continent most affected by delayed vaccination timelines … There is little chance that the divide over access to vaccines will ever be bridged. Covax, the WHO-sponsored initiative to ship vaccines to emerging economies, has failed to live up to (modest) expectations. </p>
  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Despite flattering press releases, donations from rich countries also cover only a fraction of the needs. Finally, the focus in developed economies is shifting towards administering booster doses of coronavirus vaccines, which will compound shortages of raw materials and production bottlenecks.</p>
  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Over the past year, political leaders have been busy responding to short-term emergencies while the pandemic was raging. They now need to design a longer-term strategy to tackle the coronavirus, as living with Covid will become the new normal. </p>

        <p class="dcr-vdb1rb"><strong class="calibre12">Brazil will give Covid booster shots to immunosuppressed or vulnerable people, and citizens over the age of 80, beginning on 15 September, the health minister Marcelo Queiroga has said.</strong></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Queiroga said Pfizer’s vaccine made in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech will be used as the additional dose in those groups. He said the decision, which the World Health Organization has generally warned against due to a lack of safety and efficacy data, stems from the spread of the Delta variant and the need to increase protection for more vulnerable people.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">It comes after it <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/aug/24/coronavirus-live-news-hawaii-governor-wants-to-curb-travel-israel-boosters-beating-delta?page=with:block-612520fe8f08b1506f20d903#block-612520fe8f08b1506f20d903">emerged yesterday</a> Brazil had leaked its vaccine supply contract with Pfizer. It shows it provided it with indemnity from possible citizen lawsuits over potential adverse events after it provided jabs at cheaper prices and watered down demands for sovereign assets to be put up to as collateral.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">It is believed to be the first time in history that a contract between a state and a pharmaceutical company has been published in full, with Brazil in violation of the confidentiality rules established.<br class="calibre8"/></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Reportedly, the price paid for 100m jabs, at US$10 each, was 2.3 times lower than the rate the EU is estimated to have paid, following tough negotiating by the government of Jair Bolsonaro.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Earlier this year, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-02-23/held-to-ransom-pfizer-demands-governments-gamble-with-state-assets-to-secure-vaccine-deal">reported that one official</a> who was present in an unnamed South American country’s negotiations described Pfizer’s demands as “high-level bullying” and said the government felt like it was being “held to ransom” in order to access life-saving vaccines.<br class="calibre8"/></p>

        <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Five people in Auckland, New Zealand, who received Covid-19 jabs last month may have got a dose of saline solution instead but health officials did not tell them, RNZ reports.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The New Zealand public broadcaster reported that the ministry of health confirmed that the issue was discovered at the end of a day when “the vaccine stock didn’t match the number of doses administered”.</p>

<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The broadcaster understands the vaccination centre could not determine who the five people affected of the 732 vaccinated that day were. The government is still seeking advice on whether they all should receive another dose, according to officials. Everyone involved would receive a letter in the next 24 hours </p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">A vial of the Pfizer vaccine usually contains multiple doses which are then diluted using saline solution once it has thawed on-site. RNZ understands that it is possible those people could have received very little vaccine or mere saline solution.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">At a parliamentary select committee meeting today, Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said the delay in making the information public was “regrettable”. He revealed he was also aware of at least one more case of vaccine error which had prompted revaccinations.</p>

  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">I think it would have been better if they had been more up front sooner after this happened … They did intend to get in touch with people to let the know what had happened, they did intend for this information to be made public. I think it would have been better if that had happened earlier but he also indicated that there was still some disagreement as to what the most likely thing to have happened here would have been.</p>
  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Our utilisation rates of the vaccine doses sits at about 99.5% when the World Health Organization … say to plan for a 10% vaccine wastage rate and we’ve got less than half a per cent. That’s a sign that the vaccine is being rolled out very safely.</p>

        <p class="dcr-vdb1rb"><strong class="calibre12">US multinational investment bank Goldman Sachs has made it compulsory for its staff to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus to work in its American offices.</strong></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">From 7 September, all employees, along with clients and visitors, would need to be doubled jabbed to enter its buildings, it said, while it would also introduce mandatory once-a-week testing for staff, the BBC reports.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Proof of vaccination status would be required via an app from October, it added, and unvaccinated workers are to be expected to work from home.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Face masks would also be required from today – regardless of vaccination status – in all common areas of its buildings, except while seated for eating and drinking.<br class="calibre8"/></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The bank had previously ordered its US bankers to disclose their vaccine status before returning to the office but refrained from mandating them.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Richard Gnodde, the head of Goldman Sachs International, told the BBC that the bank would not insist on people being vaccinated, nor would it force people to return if they felt uncomfortable.<br class="calibre8"/></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“[We will] continue to manage our exit from this in a cautious and appropriate way to make sure that our people feel comfortable,” he told the BBC.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Last week, the US pharmaceutical company Moderna – the Massachusetts firm that supplies 41% of the US’s Covid vaccines – faced questions after it held off from introducing a staff jab mandate after Johnson &amp; Johnson announced it would impose the measure.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">However, Pfizer employees have the option of participating in regular weekly testing if they do not wish to get vaccinated against Covid-19.</p>

<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The New York Times reports that while China has fully vaccinated about 55% of its huge population, officials have said that it needs to reach 80% for herd immunity.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Authorities said they would “hold accountable” people who refused to be vaccinated, unless they had a medical exemption, if they spread the virus; though they did not state what the punishment would amount to.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">It comes after several cities in central Hubei province announced that people who refused to be vaccinated would have that entered into their “personal credit score”, meaning they could be barred from going to work or entering hospitals, the NYT reports.<br class="calibre8"/></p>

        <p class="dcr-vdb1rb"><strong class="calibre12">China has criticised the US “politicisation” of efforts to trace the origin of the coronavirus and restated demands for a US military laboratory to be investigated, amid the release of an <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/aug/25/coronavirus-live-news-japan-to-expand-state-of-emergency-biden-review-of-covid-origins-reportedly-inconclusive?page=with:block-6125c7848f080840ca17a986#block-6125c7848f080840ca17a986">“inconclusive” American intelligence community report</a> on the virus’ origins.<br class="calibre8"/></strong></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“Scapegoating China cannot whitewash the US,” Fu Cong, director general of the ministry of foreign affairs’ arms control department, said. </p> 
<blockquote class="quoted">

 <div class="calibre8">
  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">If they want to baselessly accuse China, they better be prepared to accept the counterattack from China ... If Dr Tedros believes that we should not rule out the hypothesis of a lab leak, well, he knows where to go. He needs to go to the US labs.</p>
 </div>  
</blockquote> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">China has said a laboratory leak was highly unlikely, and it has ridiculed a theory that coronavirus escaped from a lab in the city of Wuhan, where Covid-19 infections emerged in late 2019, setting off the pandemic, Reuters reports.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">As we reported earlier <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/aug/23/coronavirus-live-news-taiwan-domestic-vaccine-china-zero-new-cases-israel-booster?page=with:block-6123cadb8f08cc0d8b00749f#block-6123cadb8f08cc0d8b00749f">this week</a>, it has instead suggested that the virus slipped out of a lab in Fort Detrick, Maryland, in 2019. “It is only fair that if the US insists that this is a valid hypothesis, they should do their turn and invite the investigation into their labs,” said Fu.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Yesterday, China’s envoy to the United Nations asked the head of the World Health Organization for an investigation into US labs.<br class="calibre8"/></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The BBC reports that it the Fort Detrick lab was previously the centre of the US biological weapons programme and now houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox. </p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Zhao Lijian, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, recently backed a rap song by a Chinese nationalist group suggesting dastardly plots were cooked up in the facility.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">With growing western coverage over the origin of the virus, with a Channel 4 documentary this week posing the question – did Covid-19 leak from a lab in China – the superpower’s media machine has been on the offensive.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has aired a special report, “The Dark History behind Fort Detrick”, focusing on containment breaches at the lab in 2019, to reinforce claims of poor lab security made by Chinese officials, the BBC reports.</p>

<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Reuters reports that hundreds of millions of students have been stuck at home for months, with little or no access to online education for a majority of the poor.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“We have requested all states to try to vaccinate all school teachers on priority before Teachers’ Day, which is celebrated on 5 September,” health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Twitter. He said states would be given more than 20m additional doses for the purpose.</p>

<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Prime minister Narendra Modi’s home state Gujarat said it would resume physical classes for middle school students from 2 September, at half the capacity, for the first time in more than 18 months. Schools reopened for older children nearly a month ago.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">A parliamentary report said this month the pandemic disrupted the education of nearly 320m Indian students in various schools, colleges and universities.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">It recommended “accentuated vaccine programmes for all students, teachers and allied staff so that schools may start functioning normally at the earliest”.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">India has administered 596m vaccine doses, giving at least one dose to nearly half of its 944m adults and the required two doses to 14%.</p>

        <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Thanks for reading – it’s time for me to hand over to my colleague Mattha Busby. Before I go, here’s a quick summary of the day’s events:</p> 
<ul class="calibre_feed_list"> 
 <li class="calibre5">The review into Covid’s origins ordered by the Biden administration 90 days ago is inconclusive, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/25/us-intelligence-biden-inconclusive-report-covid-origins-wuhan-lab-animals">according to US media reports.</a></li>

 <li class="calibre5">Researchers say protection provided by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines starts to wane within six months. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) member Prof Adam Finn said the results could support a booster shot for the elderly.</li> 
 <li class="calibre5">Patients who have recovered from Covid in<strong class="calibre12"> Vietnam</strong> will be offered a monthly allowance if they agree to stay on to help health workers struggling to cope with the surge in infections.</li> 
 <li class="calibre5">The number of young smokers in <strong class="calibre12">England </strong>rose by a quarter in first lockdown. Nevertheless, the number of people who stopped smoking <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/aug/25/number-of-young-smokers-rose-by-a-quarter-in-first-lockdown-england-study-shows">altogether increased</a>.<br class="calibre8"/></li>

        <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Private PCR Covid test providers in the <strong class="calibre12">UK</strong> could risk enforcement action over misleading advertising and failing to deliver results on time, the competition watchdog warned.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said a range of harmful practices, such as upfront prices that do not include additional charges and failing to deliver results within stated timescales, could breach consumer protection law.<br class="calibre8"/></p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">CMA general counsel Sarah Cardell said:</p>

  <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">PCR test providers should be in no doubt that they need to get on the right side of the law. If they don’t, they risk enforcement action.</p>

 </div>   
</blockquote> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said on Monday that 82 providers could lose government approval to sell travel tests following a review by ministers into misleading costs from “cowboy” providers.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The move comes amid mounting concerns that the Covid testing regime for people returning to England is on the brink of collapse, after ministers decided to leave provision to the private sector.</p> 
<p class="dcr-vdb1rb">A further 57 companies have been removed from the list as they no longer exist or do not provide tests for people to use on day two and day eight after returning from many foreign countries.</p>

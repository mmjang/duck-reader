Long throws, free-kicks, deep free-kicks, corners, they have such size and physicality that it is almost impossible to deal with the first ball and you have to keep fighting until it is cleared.

Mwepu proved difficult to contain and the wing-back superbly controlled a lofted pass before finding Taylor Richards on the edge of the box but the 20-year-old sent his first-time shot over the bar. Cardiff, who themselves made eight changes, started with a burst but lacked rhythm and to make matters worse the captain, Sean Morrison, one of three players retained from Saturday, went off with a knee injury.</p><p>Cardiff roused after the break, Ryan Wintle going close to an equaliser after meeting Perry Ng’s cross but any optimism was short-lived and by the time James Collins sent a downward header against the crossbar, the visitors had increased their lead.

Tully Kearney, as locked on a gold medal chance as you could find, gets caught in the last few metres. She qualified fastest, a second and a half quicker than second place, seven seconds quicker than the rest. But Zhang Li ploughs through the last 50 as Kearney starts to tire, and beats her to the wall with a half stroke on her final approach. Remarkable finish. Gold to China, silver to Great Britain, bronze to Italy’s Monica Boggioni. \nThis is the 200m freestyle S5 event, the classification that includes swimmers who have the majority use of their arms and hands, but limited or no use of their legs. Kearney has to rely on her arm speed, and you could see her strokes starting to fade through the final lap. \nIn the men’s final of the same event, Francesco Bocciardo takes gold for Italy in a Games record time of 2:26:76.

With about six minutes left on the clock.  \nThat was quite the thrashing for Australia. Didn’t score from open play. Scored once from a penalty. A lot of flat shots that were easily stopped. Two or three decent shots that almost sneaked through the defence, and one off the crossbar. But it was popgun compared to Israel’s shooting, which constantly got good bounce and backspin to get over or past defenders even when they did make contact with the ball.  \nLihi Ben David scored six times for the winners, she was impressive with her spin shots doing most of the damage.  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n  \n  \n     Tyan Taylor of Australia and Brodie Smith of Australia in action against Israel.

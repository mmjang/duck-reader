We play together, we play to win and we don’t let anyone or any opposition just take us lightly.”</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Asked what specifically provoked his players, the India captain replied: “I cannot give you the details of the words that were spoken. I think it’s for the cameras and the stump mics to pick that up for both teams, equally, and then be analysed.</p><div class="calibre8" id="8c4bd47e-c96d-4b60-9865-cb731bcff5a4"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="Virat Kohli celebrates with teammates after the wicket of England’s Jonny Bairstow at Lord’s." class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img3_u5.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>Virat Kohli celebrates with teammates after the wicket of England’s Jonny Bairstow at Lord’s.</span> Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“It happens in the moment when you’re playing competitive sport but it’s what you do after that situation, or how you get up from that situation, that matters.”</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Anderson has since claimed he did not believe Bumrah was trying to get him out on the third evening – physical intimidation was the aim, he wrote in his newspaper column – but the 39-year-old apologised to Joe Root after believing his subsequent verbals, as the players left the field, detracted from the England captain’s sparkling 180 not out.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">While Kohli hinted at sticking with a winning formula in Leeds unless a bare surface brings Ravichandran Ashwin into the equation, England have lost Mark Wood to a shoulder injury with the fast bowler joining Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer, Chris Woakes, Olly Stone and Stuart Broad on a growing absentee list.</p><div class="calibre8" id="0852c3d3-a714-4997-9078-3d84a85b255a"></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Asked if these issues for the home side presented his players with a golden chance for a first Test series win on English soil since 2007, Kohli took umbrage. “Even when key players are playing we think we can beat anyone in the world – we don’t wait for the opposition to be weak,” he said. “I don’t think that is the right question to ask a team that’s been playing such good cricket over the last so many years.”</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">India have not played at Headingley since a dominant innings victory in 2002 powered by centuries from Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly but Kohli is typically unconcerned about the lack of local knowledge among his current crop.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“I’m not an individual who likes to attach too much importance to things that are on the outside for us. It’s just a Test match to be played against England, be it any stadium, anywhere in India or in England.”</p></div></div></main></main></div></div></div></div><div class="calibre_navbar">

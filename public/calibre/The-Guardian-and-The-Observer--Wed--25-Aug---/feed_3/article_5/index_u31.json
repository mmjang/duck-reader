To be more specific: I have just come back from three weeks in a riverside house in the Catskills with my wife and three-month-old child. Idyllic, right? To begin with, yes. For the first couple of days of our holiday I was like <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Fotherington-Tomas\">Fotherington-Tomas</a> from the Molesworth books.

I once went on a weekend away to the country with a friend from Queens who was so freaked out by the silence that she slept with a knife under her pillow. I am not quite on that level, but there is something about countryside quiet that makes it difficult to relax. Every time I heard a creak in the middle of the night I worried about intruders, or thought that a local ghost was paying us a visit.</p><p>The countryside is always eerie, but there is something extra sinister about the Catskills because of all the <em>kill-</em>ing. The house we were renting, for example, was by the Beaverkill river surrounded by a bunch of towns with <em>kill </em>in the name. There’s a very boring reason for this: <em>kil </em>means creek in Dutch. Still, that didn’t stop the animal rights group Peta from once (unsuccessfully) demanding that the New York town of Fishkill <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/US/9609/06/fishy.name/\">change its name</a> to something that was less resonant of cruelty to marine life – such as Fishsave. While that was obviously ridiculous, I have to admit that names matter: had we had been staying in the Catsave mountains, it’s possible I would have been less creeped out. As it was, I spent much of the holiday missing the security of the city and the sound of sirens. This is all personal opinion, of course; I can’t help loving the city. If you love the countryside then good for you; there is no judgment from me. Love is love. Your feelings are valid. Just, please, beware of the ghosts.</p><ul> \n <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> \n</ul></div></main></main></div></div>",

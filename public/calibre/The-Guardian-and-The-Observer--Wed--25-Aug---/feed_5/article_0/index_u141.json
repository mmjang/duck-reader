She now has 15 gold medals to her name, just one short of swimmer Mike Kenny’s all-time record for a British Paralympian.

I broke the world record in Beijing, in London, in Rio and this morning, so for me it’s been quite overwhelming to try and keep backing that up and keep pushing on the pedals to go faster and faster.

We can celebrate with the team, which is obviously amazing but there is a bigger team behind the team you see here today and now more than ever they’re missed.”</p><div id=\"b15b8c85-edd5-41e8-87a6-6fcb46f94ebe\"><div><picture itemprop=\"contentUrl\"><img alt=\"Dame Sarah Storey broke the world record in qualifying on her way to the gold medal race\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/calibre/The-Guardian-and-The-Observer--Wed--25-Aug---/feed_5/article_0/images/img3_u47.jpg\"></picture></div><p><span></span><span>Dame Sarah Storey broke the world record in qualifying on her way to the gold medal race.</span> Photograph: Alex Whitehead/SWpix.com/Shutterstock</p></div><p>Storey had already shown her prowess in the qualifying round, taking a whole four seconds of her own world record time, posted at the last <a data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics\">Paralympics</a> in Rio in 2016.

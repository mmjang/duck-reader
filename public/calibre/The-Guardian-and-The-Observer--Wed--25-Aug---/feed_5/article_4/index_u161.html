She held a lead of 2.19sec over China’s Li Zhang, the S5 champion at 50m, 100m and 200m in Rio, at 300m and was still swimming at world-record pace inside the final 25m.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Her huge early effort started to tell in the final 15m, however, as Zhang started to eat into Kearney’s advantage, and the 2017 world champion touched 0.12sec in front.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Kearney was born with cerebral palsy and developed generalised dystonia, a neurological movement disorder, in her teens.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">She was forced to withdraw from the Rio <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics">Paralympics</a> in 2016 due to a significant progression of her condition and installed a 13ft x 6ft pool in her garden at the start of the coronavirus pandemic – “no waves, still water, with a Bunjee attached to a fence post” – to ensure that she could continue training towards her goal of Paralympic competition.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“There was a question mark over whether I’d ever get to a Paralympic Games and the fact that I’ve been able to race and come away with a medal is crazy,” Kearney said.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“I thought after Rio, the Paralympics wouldn’t be possible, I wouldn’t be able to swim any more, so this is obviously a massive deal and it’s all down to the amazing support staff, the amazing team. I just swam.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“I’ve not had that much training, I’ve been dealing with injuries and things. I was nervous my fitness wouldn’t be good enough to swim 200 so to go that close was pretty impressive and I’ve got to be pleased with that.”</p><div class="calibre8" id="04918ddc-ffa5-4b63-85a9-8a536f9649ee"><div class="calibre8"><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><img alt="Reece Dunn won silver in the men’s S14 100m butterfly" class="calibre3" loading="lazy" src="images/img3_u53.jpg"/></picture></div><div class="calibre8"><span></span><span>Reece Dunn won silver in the men’s S14 100m butterfly.</span> Photograph: Reuters</div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Dunn, the world record holder for the men’s 100m butterfly S14, earned ParalympicsGB’s first silver medal in the pool, finishing a third of a second behind Gabriel Bandeira of Brazil.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Dunn, a 25-year-old from Plymouth competing at the Games for the first time, set a new Paralympic record of 55.99sec in his heat and reached the turn just 0.01sec behind Bandeira in Wednesday’s final, with both swimmers a fifth of a second behind Lawrence Sapp of the US. A faster turn by Bandeira gave the Brazilian a narrow advantage which he held throughout the final 50m, taking the gold by 0.36sec and taking more than a second off Dunn’s record from earlier in the day with a time of 54.76sec.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“Obviously I’m happy about it,” Dunn said “I’m a little disappointed in my finish, I lost it there, but still happy nonetheless. I knew it was going a tough race coming in, it was going to go down to the last five metres or so and he obviously beat me to it.”</p><div class="calibre8" id="cacb609b-1f2c-46f9-88f5-9842b6c5a7c4"><div class="calibre8" data-atom-id="69b832e4-8afc-4367-b07c-19a59110c048" data-atom-type="guide"><details data-atom-id="69b832e4-8afc-4367-b07c-19a59110c048" data-snippet-type="guide"><summary><span>Quick Guide</span><h4 class="dcr-15l9ami">ParalympicsGB day one roundup</h4><span><span><span></span>Show</span></span></summary><div class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><p class="dcr-vdb1rb"><b class="calibre12">ParalympicsGB</b> made a winning start to their mixed wheelchair rugby campaign with a 50-47 win over Canada, thanks in no small part to 27 tries from Jim Roberts. “It was a really good performance,” said Roberts. “The game was very physical, I’ll probably have some bruises in the morning from that one. The tournament is wide open, it will be one of the toughest tournaments there’s ever been at the Paralympics which is great for the sport.” GB face New Zealand next, with the top two teams in each group of four advancing to the semi-finals. </p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb"><b class="calibre12">Piers Gilliver</b> turned his attention to the épée event after being eliminated from the men’s sabre A in the last 16. The 26-year-old fencer from Gloucester lost 15-12 to China’s Li Hao but still has the épée discipline to come on Thursday. “I am very disappointed with today because it was a tough draw in the elimination round after the pool matches didn’t really go as I’d hoped,” he said. “I fought well, and I just managed to miss out, which is tough to take.” <b class="calibre12">Gemma Collis-McCann</b> went out in he group stage of the women’s sabre A. </p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The opening day of the table tennis competitions proved to be a mixed bag for ParalympicsGB’s 11-strong squad. <b class="calibre12">William Bayley</b>, a gold medal winner in Rio, was among three GB victorious athletes, beating Maksym Chudzicki in Class 7 Group B, while <b class="calibre12">Megan Shackleton</b> was one of four to taste defeat, losing 3-0 by China’s Ying Zhou in Class 4 Group A.</p></div></div><div class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8"><div class="calibre8">Was this helpful?</div></div></div><div class="calibre8" data-testid="feedback" hidden="">Thank you for your feedback.</div></div></details></div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Shaw, who celebrated her 18<sup class="calibre14">th</sup> birthday three weeks ago, had earlier won Great Britain’s first swimming medal of the Games in the second of day’s finals, taking bronze in the women’s 400m freestyle S9.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Shaw turned in second at the halfway stage behind Australia’s Lakeisha Patterson but was back in third at 300m as Zsofia Konkoly, who was fastest in qualifying, steadily closed the gap on the leader. Konkoly could not claw back her deficit in time, however, and she was touched off by 0.08sec in one of the day’s closest finishes.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Ellie Robinson had been expected to go into the final of the women’s 50m freestyle S6 with a serious chance of a medal but pulled out of the event before the morning’s heats to concentrate instead on the 50m butterfly S6, in which she won gold as a 15-year-old in Rio de Janeiro five years ago.</p><div class="calibre8" id="62e20a41-9f2c-4473-8392-e7a884fc4718"><div class="calibre8" data-cy="embed-block"><div class="calibre8"></div><div class="calibre8">Sign up for our Tokyo 2020 briefing with all the news, views and previews for the Paralympic Games.</div></div></div><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">That left Team GB with a total of seven qualifiers for the first day’s finals. Louise Fiddes and Jessica-Jane Applegate finished fifth and sixth respectively behind the Russian Paralympic Committee’s Valeriia Shabalina in the women’s 100m butterfly S14, while Zara Mulooly finished seventh in the women’s 50m freestyle S10 and Suzanna Hext, another British swimmer making her Paralympic debut, finished fourth in the 200m freestyle S5.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“To be honest, I’m really happy that it’s so competitive,” Fiddes said after her final. “It just kind of proves that the Paralympic movement is really taking a step forwards and even though I didn’t do a good time, I’m just glad that the Games are happening after everything that’s gone on.”</p></div></div></main></main></div></div></div></div><div class="calibre_navbar">

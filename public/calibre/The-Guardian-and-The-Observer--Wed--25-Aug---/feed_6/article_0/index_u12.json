He drives Jasprit Bumrah’s first ball for four, a touch uppishly through the gully, and then shovels a single to mid-on to reach double figures for the first time in a Test for nearly five years.

The first ball, from Ishant Sharma, is a gift on the pads, and Rory Burns tucks it away for a single. It turns out to be a double gift, as it was a no-ball too. Haseeb Hameed, who was horribly nervous in the first innings at Lord’s, starts with a nice decisive leave. Then Ishant carries on handing out the presents by bowling another no-ball, followed by a wide. Hameed, heartened, plays a cracking cut for four. But by the end of a long over Ishant is finding his feet, nipping one back to hurry Hameed into a Harrow drive. <strong>England are only 70 away from a first-innings lead.</strong></p>\n        \n        <p>Updated\n            <time datetime=\"2021-08-25T14:15:45.000Z\">at 3.15pm BST</time>\n        </p>\n        \n        \n\n\n\n    </div>\n\n    <div data-sort-time=\"1629900508000\" id=\"block-61264ea08f080840ca17b144\" itemprop=\"liveBlogUpdate\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/BlogPosting\">\n\n        \n\n        <p>\n                <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/aug/25/england-v-india-third-test-day-one-live?page=with:block-61264ea08f080840ca17b144#block-61264ea08f080840ca17b144\" itemprop=\"url\">\n                    \n\n    <time data-relativeformat=\"med\" datetime=\"2021-08-25T14:08:28.000Z\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">3.08pm <span>BST</span></time>\n    <span>15:08</span>\n\n\n\n                </a>\n        </p>\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        <p><strong>Here’s Brian Withington, sounding mystified. </strong>“From where I was watching, the Headingley pitch seemed to be behaving quite reasonably.

Jimmy Anderson, using the first new ball well for once, destroyed the top order, Kohli included. Ollie Robinson dealt with the midriff, and Craig Overton and Sam Curran lopped off the tail. England have done to India what Australia did to them in the last Test at Headingley. The only trouble is, Australia managed to grab defeat from the jaws of a straightforward victory. And England are capable of matching any batting collapse. But, for at least a few minutes, they can bask in this: they were excellent, and India were awful. Now England just need their openers to get through the first two overs.</p> \n<div data-component=\"image\" data-media-id=\"d55fc2f827aeef83e562f29b496adcb4fdcb87e9\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> \n  \n  \n  \n <div> \n  <picture> \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   <img alt=\"The big screen scoreboard shows the India first innings score of 78.\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d55fc2f827aeef83e562f29b496adcb4fdcb87e9/0_0_5243_3535/master/5243.jpg?width=300quality=85auto=formatfit=maxs=2650dc4240f36436e40f80ac85a8c542\"> \n  </picture> \n </div> \n <p><span> \n    </span> The big screen scoreboard shows the India first innings score of 78.

Phil Carter (sadly died two years ago). Played for a West Mids hockey club. Got into the first team when he was 15. Left the first team when he was past 50. Hugely competitive on the pitch. Though never a dickhead (the only one I have ever seen who has played at a high level). After dropping from the 1<sup>st</sup> team, was happy to go down all the teams to the bottom. And he could drink anyone under the table. He would also turn out for the club rugby and cricket teams whenever possible. Often on the same day as a hockey game.</p> \n<p>This from a rival club: ‘Phil was a fine player and was well known to many of our guys who played first team hockey against him from the 1980s onwards. He represented all that is good about club hockey; fiercely competitive on the field and very sociable and hospitable off it. He was very proud to play for Old Hales and he was clearly lending his experience to the younger players in the lower sides over the latter seasons. Phil was simply a top bloke and what an epitaph that is.

This has been a weird series for batsmen: only three of them are averaging 30 – Rohit with 42, Rahul with 48, and Root with a frankly ridiculous 128.\n        \n        Updated\n            at 3.34pm BST\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    3.15pm BST\n    15:15\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        1st over: England 9-0 (Burns 1, Hameed 5) So here they are, England’s 22nd different opening pair since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012. The first ball, from Ishant Sharma, is a gift on the pads, and Rory Burns tucks it away for a single. It turns out to be a double gift, as it was a no-ball too. Haseeb Hameed, who was horribly nervous in the first innings at Lord’s, starts with a nice decisive leave. Then Ishant carries on handing out the presents by bowling another no-ball, followed by a wide. Hameed, heartened, plays a cracking cut for four. But by the end of a long over Ishant is finding his feet, nipping one back to hurry Hameed into a Harrow drive. England are only 70 away from a first-innings lead.\n        \n        Updated\n            at 3.15pm BST\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    3.08pm BST\n    15:08\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        Here’s Brian Withington, sounding mystified. “From where I was watching, the Headingley pitch seemed to be behaving quite reasonably.

He opted to bat, whereupon it all went horribly wrong. Jimmy Anderson, using the first new ball well for once, destroyed the top order, Kohli included. Ollie Robinson dealt with the midriff, and Craig Overton and Sam Curran lopped off the tail. England have done to India what Australia did to them in the last Test at Headingley. The only trouble is, Australia managed to grab defeat from the jaws of a straightforward victory. And England are capable of matching any batting collapse. But, for at least a few minutes, they can bask in this: they were excellent, and India were awful. Now England just need their openers to get through the first two overs. \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n  \n  \n     The big screen scoreboard shows the India first innings score of 78.

Rohit then twizzles a no ball to square leg and four dots follow; I daresay we’ll be seeing Anderson soon.  \nI really enjoy discussing or comparing the merits of sportsmen and women across different fields as it often results in more people being aware of less popular sports,” emails Neil Mackie, “which brings me on to Rachel Atherton. She has been world champion in downhill mountain bike five times, overall DH world cup winner six times and has won 37 DH world cup races. She also won 14 consecutive world cup races between 2015 and 2017, dominance that underplayed what was happening, when other world class riders accepted they were only fighting for second place, with Rachel so far ahead. The lack of attention for such an exciting and interesting sport played to the wider public not knowing about her but they really should.” \nDownhill mountain biking, I’m terrified even reading the words. \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    2.23pm BST\n    14:23\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n        35th over: India 64-5 (Rohit 18, Jadeja 3) Nasser is back to castigating India’s bottom four, also saying that Pant isn’t a six in England and perhaps Kohli should’ve picked Ashwin, who’d then bat at eight. But it’s Jadeja facing, and he runs a single past gully, then after Rohit flicks one more to deep square, he takes another to cover. Three off the over – by the standards, an absolute deluge.  \n“Far be it from me to denigrate Mr Peaty’s achievements and so on,” says Tom Farrell, “but even within the world of swimming, breaststroke is hardly the pinnacle. No serious Australian or American swimmer would be guided towards breaststroke, which is probably why until this year every gold medal since the war won by a British male swimmer was in breaststroke. I think we might have to accept the rest of the world aren’t that bothered....” \nI didn’t know about that, but now you mention it I do conceive of breaststroke as what my mum does so as not to ruin her hairdo. \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    2.18pm BST\n    14:18\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        34th over: India 61-5 (Rohit 17, Jadeja 1) I’ll say it again: I love the way Robinson has bowled since his first spell, challenging the outside edge in the knowledge that bowled and lb are difficult for him on this track. His first ball raps Jadeja’s pad after the batsman misses a flick but pitched outside leg, his second just misses that outside edge, and his third straightens then takes bat just before pad. England have got one here, they really have, though Jadeja gets away when he presses the final delivery into the off side. \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    2.15pm BST\n    14:15\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n        33rd over: India 60-5 (Rohit 17, Jadeja 0) Overton is growing into this, and after four dots, he goes wide then moves it away from Rohit who, slightly square, has to play at it from around his right shoulder. He edges ... and the ball drops just shy of Bairstow at two. That’s another maiden, and Overton now has four from seven.  \n“Greatest ever sportsman?” asks Patrick Nagle. “Easy. Phil Carter (sadly died two years ago). Played for a West Mids hockey club. Got into the first team when he was 15. Left the first team when he was past 50. Hugely competitive on the pitch. Though never a dickhead (the only one I have ever seen who has played at a high level). After dropping from the 1st team, was happy to go down all the teams to the bottom. And he could drink anyone under the table. He would also turn out for the club rugby and cricket teams whenever possible. Often on the same day as a hockey game. \nThis from a rival club: ‘Phil was a fine player and was well known to many of our guys who played first team hockey against him from the 1980s onwards. He represented all that is good about club hockey; fiercely competitive on the field and very sociable and hospitable off it. He was very proud to play for Old Hales and he was clearly lending his experience to the younger players in the lower sides over the latter seasons. Phil was simply a top bloke and what an epitaph that is. It is such a shame that he was taken so early in his life.’\n        \n        \n        Updated\n            at 2.15pm BST\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    2.10pm BST\n    14:10\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n        32nd over: India 60-5 (Rohit 17, Jadeja 0) Rohit hooks Robinson for one, rolling wrists to prevent the ball from ballooning – the only run off the over. England have started very well after lunch, which sets up the inevitable disintegration all the better.  \nTom Knight would like to wish you all a happy Ben Stokes Day. \n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    2.07pm BST\n    14:07\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        31st over: India 59-5 (Rohit 16, Jadeja 0) Anderson v Jadeja sounds extremely tasty, and I’m sure it won’t be long before it’s bestowed upon us. On which point, Anderson not playing T20 is probably good for this contest, because the antipathy isn’t ruined by the IPL and nonsense like lasting friendship. Back in the middle, Rohit feathers a single behind, the only run from Overton’s over. \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n        ",

clues about when the central bank will start slowing its bond-buying programme, and how fast it might move</p> \n<p>But given uncertainty over the Delta variant, he may be cautious about making too many commitments about tapering.</p> \n<p><strong>Willem Sels, </strong>Chief Investment Officer, Private Banking and Wealth Management, <strong>HSBC, </strong>explains:</p> \n<blockquote>  \n <span> \n   </span>  \n <div>\n  <p> The minutes of the latest Fed meeting have already made it clear that most committee members believe tapering should start before year end. But given that there are still three meetings left this year, markets will look for any clues as to which meeting will see the starting gun fired.</p>\n  <p> In our view, more progress needs to be made towards full employment, and September is thus unlikely, but it is a close call between November and December.</p>\n  <p>The market is also looking for any potential clarification on the speed of tapering once the process starts and on its composition. Some comments by Fed members have suggested that treasuries and mortgage-backed securities holdings could be tapered at the same pace, and bond purchases could be brought down to zero by the end of 2022, but there is no official stance yet. </p>\n </div>    \n</blockquote>\n        </div>\n        \n        <p>Updated\n            <time datetime=\"2021-08-25T14:13:07.000Z\">at 3.13pm BST</time>\n        </p>\n        \n        \n\n\n\n    </div>\n\n    <div data-sort-time=\"1629897492000\" id=\"block-612641178f080840ca17b05d\" itemprop=\"liveBlogUpdate\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/BlogPosting\">\n\n        \n\n        <p>\n                <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/aug/25/uk-supply-chain-crisis-retail-food-tourism-ftse-100-business-live?page=with:block-612641178f080840ca17b05d#block-612641178f080840ca17b05d\" itemprop=\"url\">\n                    \n\n    <time data-relativeformat=\"med\" datetime=\"2021-08-25T13:18:12.000Z\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">2.18pm <span>BST</span></time>\n    <span>14:18</span>\n\n\n\n                </a>\n        </p>\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        <div itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n        <p>Supply bottlenecks and labor constraints are weighing on US manufacturers (just like in the UK!) warns <strong>Greg Daco</strong> of <strong>Oxford Economics</strong>, but the broad trend is upward:</p> \n<div data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GregDaco/status/1430517237367119878\"> \n <blockquote>\n  <span>Gregory Daco </span>\n  <span>(@GregDaco)</span>\n  <div dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><p>üá∫üá∏Durable goods <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/orders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#orders</a> modest slip -0.1% in July <br>‚¨ÜÔ∏èmotor vehicles, machinery, metals, computers<br>‚¨áÔ∏èaircraft, elect equip</p><p>ü§èCore capital gds orders flat</p><p>üëçShipments +2.2%: broad-based<br>üëçCore shipments solid +1.0%</p><p>Still solid trend despite supply bottlenecks &amp; labor constraints <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://t.co/sPAv7GFhux\">pic.twitter.com/sPAv7GFhux</a></p></div>\n  \n  <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GregDaco/status/1430517237367119878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 25, 2021</a>\n </blockquote> \n</div> \n<div data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chadmoutray/status/1430517539386413061\"> \n <blockquote>\n  <span>Chad Moutray </span>\n  <span>(@chadmoutray)</span>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">New orders for durable goods edged 0.1%, pulling back from a record $257.6 billion in June to $257.2 billion in July.

But given that there are still three meetings left this year, markets will look for any clues as to which meeting will see the starting gun fired.\n   In our view, more progress needs to be made towards full employment, and September is thus unlikely, but it is a close call between November and December.\n  The market is also looking for any potential clarification on the speed of tapering once the process starts and on its composition. Some comments by Fed members have suggested that treasuries and mortgage-backed securities holdings could be tapered at the same pace, and bond purchases could be brought down to zero by the end of 2022, but there is no official stance yet. \n     \n\n        \n        \n        Updated\n            at 3.13pm BST\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n                \n                    \n\n    2.18pm BST\n    14:18\n\n\n\n                \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n        Supply bottlenecks and labor constraints are weighing on US manufacturers (just like in the UK!) warns Greg Daco of Oxford Economics, but the broad trend is upward: \n \n \n  Gregory Daco \n  (@GregDaco)\n  üá∫üá∏Durable goods #orders modest slip -0.1% in July ‚¨ÜÔ∏èmotor vehicles, machinery, metals, computers‚¨áÔ∏èaircraft, elect equipü§èCore capital gds orders flatüëçShipments +2.2%: broad-basedüëçCore shipments solid +1.0%Still solid trend despite supply bottlenecks & labor constraints pic.twitter.com/sPAv7GFhux\n  \n  August 25, 2021\n  \n \n \n \n  Chad Moutray \n  (@chadmoutray)\n  New orders for durable goods edged 0.1%, pulling back from a record $257.6 billion in June to $257.2 billion in July.

Even with a large number of people coming off furlough in August and September, it‚Äôs likely that high demand for workers will continue to cause shortages through the autumn.\n  There will be particular pressures in logistics, food manufacturing and hospitality as we gear up for Christmas, and hiring for this period has already started.\n    \n \nThis tight labour market means demand for workers is strong. But the pressing issue for the government, Carberry added, is that labour shortages will limit business and economic growth in the months to come. \n \n \n \n  Neil Carberry \n  (@RECNeil)\n  There are short- & longer-term issues here. Peak demand this autumn will be affected by shortages, even with furlough ending. Businesses are working hard to address this - but Government also needs to stay close and support. This is about food on shelves, not politics.

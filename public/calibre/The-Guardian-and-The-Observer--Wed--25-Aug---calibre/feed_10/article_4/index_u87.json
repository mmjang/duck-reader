There are sequences of people drinking in crowded bars, chatting on the streets and tending to their gardens, as well as people protesting, building barricades and hurling Molotovs. Peress even casts a detached eye on the leisure pursuits of the upper-middle classes: foxhunting and flower shows, bowling tournaments and cricket matches, all of which seem to be happening in a parallel universe to the violence and upheaval.

In 2006, Donaldson, a member of the IRA, was outed as a spy for MI5 and executed. His double life was unknown to Peress at the time, which goes some way to explaining the book’s title, Whatever You Say, Say Nothing, a reference to a warning printed on IRA posters widely distributed in republican areas of Belfast in the 1970s.

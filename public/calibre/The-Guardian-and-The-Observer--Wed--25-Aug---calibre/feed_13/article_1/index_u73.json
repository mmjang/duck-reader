In the mid-1970s, they controlled as little as 20% of the meatpacking market. What changed? The answer, in part, lies beyond the meatpacking sector, with corn farmers and grocery stores.</p><p>It’s no accident that the 1970s marked the <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/41108/18011_aer785_1_.pdf?v=0\">re-ascendance of a concentrated meatpacking industry</a>. The early and mid-70s were a period of explosive growth and high demand for agricultural products, when farmers across the country were experiencing some of the highest relative incomes seen in US agriculture, before or since.</p><p>During this time, farmers and ranchers with cash to hand and access to cheap financing were looking to make investments in their agricultural businesses that would improve cashflow.

Today, <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/sector-at-a-glance/\">less than 5% of feedlots control 80%</a> of the fed cattle market, most of which are located in just five states.</p><p>As the number of cattle suppliers that a given meatpacker had to work with declined, the number of meat buyers also diminished, and their average size grew.</p><p>By the 90s, consolidation in the US grocery sector was already well under way, with the top 20 food retailers in the country selling nearly 40% of all retail groceries. By 2019, the top four food retailers were capturing that same 40% of sales, according to the <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/retailing-wholesaling/retail-trends/\">USDA</a>, while in metropolitan areas, their share was <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/357k/357kNewMeatIndustry.pdf\">over 70%</a>. Grocery’s big four – Walmart, Target, Albertsons and Kroger – are able to exert a surprising amount of power over their suppliers, even over the big four meatpackers.</p><p>“It’s what we call the power of the purchase order,” says Errol Schweizer, former vice president of grocery for Whole Foods, now an industry adviser. “Retail buyers have a lot of say over the supply chain in terms of their ability to send a purchase order or withhold the purchase order.” </p><p>The power of the purchase order is significant, as contracts with major retailers are both extremely competitive and lucrative. The biggest and most centralised meatpackers are usually able to offer the lowest prices to supply retailers with vast and reliable quantities of familiar meat cuts daily, and the fewer meat suppliers a grocery chain works with, the lower their costs of doing business. In this way, as fewer and fewer grocery chains own more and more of the market, they turn to the fewest and biggest meatpackers, further entrenching a system of mega-players all the way through the beef system.</p><div><p>But the clout that comes with being a mega-buyer has its limits, as has been witnessed with continuously climbing beef prices. These increases are a result of Covid-related slowdowns in meatpacking, caused mainly by outbreaks in meatpacking plants that led to <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://investigatemidwest.org/2020/04/16/tracking-covid-19s-impact-on-meatpacking-workers-and-industry/\">thousands of workers</a> falling ill and hundreds dying. Packers passed price increases through to their retail customers, who in turn passed them on to consumers. </p><p>The feedlot-packer-grocery mega-group might be showing signs of fraying. In 2020, Walmart made a small step towards taking over some of its own meat processing by opening a new facility in Georgia to <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2019/04/24/walmart-to-create-angus-beef-supply-chain\">make “case-ready” cuts</a> of meat, not unlike Costco’s 2019 opening of a poultry plant in Nebraska. This seems to be a sign that big retailers are looking to take back some margin from meatpackers, though currently on a very small scale.</p></div><p>However it happens, many believe that reducing the consolidated power of these big players is critical, not only to keep consumer prices low and ranchers in business, but to protect US food security. The global pandemic is not the only event to reveal just how fragile the current consolidated system is – the recent cyber-attack on JBS, which <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/10/worlds-biggest-meat-producer-jbs-pays-11m-cybercrime-ransom\">cost the company an $11m (£8m) ransom</a>, halted one-fifth of the US’s meat processing capacity for days, with the effects felt up and down the supply chain.</p><div id=\"8473cf7c-00a5-4461-9ef6-64d4f2a786f1\"><div><picture itemprop=\"contentUrl\"><img alt=\"Butchers chop up beef in Rigby, Idaho, 26 May 2020.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/calibre/The-Guardian-and-The-Observer--Wed--25-Aug---calibre/feed_13/article_1/images/img6_u12.jpg\"></picture></div><p><span></span><span>Experts say not enough was done to safeguard meat plant workers’ health during the pandemic.</span> Photograph: Natalie Behring/AFP/Getty</p></div><p>Advocates say that if one of the aims of reducing consolidation is to improve protections for workers, particularly the vulnerable meatpacking workers who <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/us-coronavirus-meat-packing-plants-food\">sickened and died from Covid-19 at rates well beyond the average</a>, the pressure must be on the whole food system, not just meatpacking companies.</p><p>“Not one grocery retailer said, ‘Hey, this isn’t right’,” Schweizer says of retail meat buyers when reports of illness and death related to plants surfaced.

The Paralympics has even more medals (539) in a shorter timespan of 12 days.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">So I’m aiming for informative rather than exhaustive, it is a briefing after all. Please don’t feel I have besmirched the reputation of your favourite nation if I neglect to mention that they’ve won a gold somewhere. We do have this though – <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2021/aug/23/tokyo-2020-paralympic-games-full-results">a comprehensive results service on the Guardian website</a>, and <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2021/aug/23/tokyo-2020-paralympic-games-full-medal-table">an interactive medal table</a> with proper flags instead of emojis and a much lower risk that I’ve typed it in wrong.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">One way of making sure I do mention something you are looking forward to – you can get in touch with me at <a data-link-name="in body link" href="mailto:martin.belam%2Btokyo@theguardian.com">martin.belam@theguardian.com</a> and pester me in advance.

 <p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Being in an empty stadium we have to be prepared to race like that, but once you finish racing that’s when it hits you, literally the stands are empty. Racing in a pandemic is hard. But it’s when you want to celebrate with people you realise you don’t have your friends and family here. We can celebrate with the team, which is obviously amazing, but there is a bigger team behind the team you see here today and now more than ever they’re missed. – <strong class="calibre12">Sarah Storey</strong></p>

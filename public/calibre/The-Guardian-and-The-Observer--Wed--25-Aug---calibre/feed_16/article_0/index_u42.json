Elizabeth Marks was the middle bit of a Ukrainian sandwich in the women’s 50m freestyle S6 final. She finished ahead of Anna Hontar, but 0.04 seconds behind Yelyzaveta Mereshko. In the velodrome, Shawn Morelli earned silver in the women’s C4 3000m individual pursuit.🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵 The hosts and beyondFourteen-year-old Miyuki Yamada became Japan’s youngest ever Paralympic medalist – with their first of these Games – with a silver in the women’s 100m backstroke S2. She finished behind Singapore’s Pin Xiu Yip, who was claiming her fifth Paralympic title after previously securing golds in Beijing and Rio. There were also opening day gold medals for Italy, Brazil, Belarus, Chile and Israel in the swimming.Miyuki Yamada poolside at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre.

They also picked up two bronzes in the Makuhari Messe for good measure. Britain’s Piers Gilliver’s interest was ended in the round of 16 by the eventual winner Li Hao.Li Hao of China (L) competes against Piers Gilliver of Britain during the Men’s Sabre Individual category A round of 16.

Add an hour for Sydney, subtract eight hours for Manchester, 13 hours for New York and 16 hours for San Francisco.🌟If you only watch one thing: 10am-2.57pm Track Cycling – there are races all Thursday morning, and then from 1.45pm we get into the women’s 3000m individual pursuit finals in three classes, with the men’s B 4000m individual pursuit final to round off Thursday at the velodrome 🥇 \n 9am-11.16am and 5pm-8.01pm Swimming – after a morning of heats, Thursday’s evening session features what should be an hour’s worth of entertaining 100m finals followed by the mixed 4x50m freestyle relay 20 points final 🥇 \n 9am-2.20pm and 4pm-10pm Table tennis – there’s more table tennis than you can shake a stick at again on Thursday with more than 128 group stage games taking place. \n 9am-8.30pm Wheelchair basketball – there are group games for both men and women all day, notably the US men face Germany at 9am, Great Britain’s women face the hosts at 11.15am in a game they need to win, and the British men face Algeria at 2.45pm. \n 9am-8.30pm Goalball – there are seven preliminary matches in both the men’s and women’s competition scattered through the day, with the USA men clashing with Brazil at 1.15pm probably being the pick of the bunch. \n 11am and 1pm and 4.30pm and 6.30pm Powerlifting – a busy day as in order it goes men’s -49kg final, women’s -41kg final, women’s -45kg final and then the men’s -54kg final 🥇 \n 4pm-8.31pm Equestrian – 47-year-old Lee Pearson has 11 Paralympic gold medals behind him, but there will be something different about competing this year, as it is the first time he will have a young family to cheer him on – albeit remotely. In a rather ambitious lockdown project, Pearson became a foster father for the first time last year. His Grade II individual dressage test is first up 🐴🥇 \n 6pm-8.30pm Wheelchair fencing – preliminaries are on all day from 9am but we get to the business end at 6pm on Thursday, with medals to be won in the men’s and women’s épée individual, in both category A and category B 🥇 \nAs it standsLike West Ham being top of the Premier League on goals scored after two matches, here’s how the somewhat irrational-looking and embryonic emoji table stood at 9pm Tokyo time. Savour this one Australia, because I doubt there will be many days when China are not top.1 🇦🇺 Australia 🥇 6 🥈 1 🥉 3 total: 102 🇨🇳 China 🥇 5 🥈 1 🥉 2 total: 83 ◻️ Not Russia 🥇 3 🥈 1 🥉 2 total: 64 🇮🇹 Italy 🥇 2 🥈 1 🥉 2 total: 55 🇺🇦 Ukraine 🥇 1 🥈 5 🥉 2 total: 86 🇬🇧 Great Britain 🥇 1 🥈 4 🥉 1 total: 67 🇧🇷 Brazil 🥇 1 🥈 1 🥉 2 total: 48 🇳🇱 Netherlands 🥇 1 🥈 1 🥉 0 total: 29 🇧🇾 Belarus 🥇 1 🥈 0 🥉 0 total: 19 🇨🇱 Chile 🥇 1 🥈 0 🥉 0 total: 19 🇮🇱 Israel 🥇 1 🥈 0 🥉 0 total: 19 🇸🇬 Singapore 🥇 1 🥈 0 🥉 0 total: 1Get in touchSomething I’d been meaning to say, the Olympics had 19 days of sport and featured 339 gold medals – well 340 because of the double high jump gold – and there was no way that I could get to mention them all individually in this series of briefings. The Paralympics has even more medals (539) in a shorter timespan of 12 days.So I’m aiming for informative rather than exhaustive, it is a briefing after all. Please don’t feel I have besmirched the reputation of your favourite nation if I neglect to mention that they’ve won a gold somewhere. We do have this though – a comprehensive results service on the Guardian website, and an interactive medal table with proper flags instead of emojis and a much lower risk that I’ve typed it in wrong.One way of making sure I do mention something you are looking forward to – you can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com and pester me in advance. I’ll see you at the same time tomorrow, take care and stay safe.The last wordSarah Storey of Great Britain after winning gold in the women’s C5 3000m individual pursuit final. Photograph: Alex Whitehead/SWpix.com/REX/ShutterstockBeing in an empty stadium we have to be prepared to race like that, but once you finish racing that’s when it hits you, literally the stands are empty. Racing in a pandemic is hard. But it’s when you want to celebrate with people you realise you don’t have your friends and family here. We can celebrate with the team, which is obviously amazing, but there is a bigger team behind the team you see here today and now more than ever they’re missed. – Sarah Storey",

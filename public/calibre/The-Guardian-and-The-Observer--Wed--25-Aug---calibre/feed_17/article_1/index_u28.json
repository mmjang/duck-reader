Then as you go up – 1.5 might have a couple more abs, a two might have all their abs, a three might have abs and some leg, fours are typically amputees.”</p><p>The point-system requires coaches to be quick with their mental arithmetic. “You’ve gotta be on top of it,” says Blair. “If you go over those 14 points it’s a technical foul. Two techs and you’re generally out of the building [the coach is formally expelled from game].”</p><p>The rules also require sophisticated team cohesion as substitutions can radically change the on-court dynamic. “Often times if one player comes into foul trouble or has an injury or isn’t playing well for whatever reason, and has to come out, that will affect more than just one player,” he says. “Maybe taking out someone will affect the line-up too much and so they might take the whole line up off. It’s not as simple as one-for-one changes.”</p><div id=\"9e18e106-b97b-442a-a25d-3d4f8b025639\"><div><picture itemprop=\"contentUrl\"><img alt=\"Jannik Blair\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/calibre/The-Guardian-and-The-Observer--Wed--25-Aug---calibre/feed_17/article_1/images/img3_u17.jpg\"></picture></div><p><span></span><span>Jannik Blair at the Rollers selection and training camp at the AIS in Canberra in June.</span> Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</p></div><p>Now 29, Blair became paraplegic when he was 12 after a car accident on his childhood property near Horsham in regional Victoria. “It’s just what you do on a farm,” he says, rolling his eyes. “I was racing my older brother from one side of the paddock to another, rolled [the ute] and went out the window.

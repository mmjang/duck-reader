They are continuing their efforts to ensure the safety of more athletes.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">Players were forced to take their chances running past Taliban checkpoints, some suffering beatings and having to avoid gunfire to reach the relative safety of the airport.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">The Australian team of the former Socceroo Craig Foster and the human rights lawyer and former Olympian Nikki Dryden – who were critical in ensuring the safety of the detained Bahrain footballer Hakeem al-Araibi in 2019 – and the director of Human Rights for All, Alison Battisson, were some of the many that swung into action and Australia quickly became the most viable escape route as Australian visas were secured for all athletes and the Australian government called for them to report to the airport.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“We are grateful to the Australian government for evacuating a large number of women footballers and athletes from Afghanistan,” said a Fifpro statement. “These young women, both as athletes and activists, have been in a position of danger and on behalf of their peers around the world we thank the international community for coming to their aid.</p><p class="dcr-vdb1rb">“We would like to pay tribute to the tireless, round-the-clock work of many people including Khalida Popal, Kelly Lindsey, Nikki Dryden, Alison Battison, Haley Carter and Craig Foster in helping them to secure safe passage out of Afghanistan.</p><div class="calibre8" id="c9ec46e1-96e8-495c-9428-73d5bc956f21"><div class="calibre8"><blockquote class="quoted"><p dir="ltr" lang="en" class="dcr-vdb1rb">Thanks to the work of many individuals and our friends in Australia, after 72 hours of all-day and all-night ops, over 75 Afghan WNT athletes, officials, and family are finally wheels up.

The women footballers have been brave and strong in a moment of crisis and we hope they will have a better life outside Afghanistan. But there is still much more work to do.

  "textContent": "A cleaner who works at the Mauritius Football Association has claimed she found a mobile phone in recording mode in the women’s toilets at its headquarters three months before a complaint was lodged with police by another employee.Two board members have stepped down over the MFA’s handling of accusations made this month by the administrative secretary, Mila Sinnasamy, that the mobile phone discovered on 30 July was concealed in a blue basket placed in the water tank of the women’s toilet at the MFA’s headquarters in Trianon, 15 km from the capital, Port Louis.According to police sources, a file on the allegations of voyeurism will be submitted to the office of the director of public prosecutions, with Fifa having said it is monitoring the situation.Now Bindou Kistnairain, who works as a cleaner at the MFA, has revealed she also saw a phone in the toilets during her shift in May but did not report it due to fears of “being fired and any retaliation”.In a letter to the Mauritius FA’s human resources officer on 4 August and seen by the Guardian, Kistnairain wrote: “It all started when I went to the toilet (left one) to pick up a plastic bin in the blue basket.

Romelu Lukaku shines on his second debut for Chelsea while we all repeat the question - what’s the point of Arsenal? Spurs sneak past Wolves with Harry Kane back on the pitch as a sub, Brighton show some love for the returning Shane Duffy and at Liverpool, a lovely Sadio Mané goal helps to beat Burnley at Anfield, something the Reds failed to do last season. Jürgen Klopp and Ole Gunnar Solskjær question the new policy of ‘letting the game flow’, suggesting the game is descending into bedlam; with the Manchester United man suggesting it is shifting “from one extreme, like basketball last season into rugby now”. Elsewhere in Mark Langdon’s European roundup, lawless anarchy erupts in France, there is more Cristiano Ronaldo disquiet, and we discuss Gareth Bale’s revealing Guardian Q&A.\n                \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n        \n            \n                    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n                \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n\n                    \n\n                    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                            Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n\n            \n\n            \n\n            \n                Support The Guardian\n                The Guardian is editorially independent.\n                    And we want to keep our journalism open and accessible to all.\n                    But we increasingly need our readers to fund our work.\n                \n                \n                    Support The Guardian\n                    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n                \n            \n\n            \n\n            \n\n        ",

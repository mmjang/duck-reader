But these fancy tactics are rendered null and void by bird feeders providing food 24/7; it is gobbled up by the dominant species, sending their numbers up, and increasing the threat to subordinate species.

Great tits sometimes kill flycatchers in scuffles over nest sites. Nature would favour these long-distance migrants by every so often delivering a hammer blow to resident species in the form of a harsh winter. Increased mortality among dominant resident species would leave the woods quieter for returning migrants, while potentially favouring the subordinate residents, which had stockpiled food or were better at finding it.

Her teammate Crystal Lane-Wright should provide lively competition.</p><p>In the pool, Australia’s Brenden Hall will be strong favourite to defend his S9 400m Freestyle title in the final at 5.10pm (9.10am). Ellie Robinson will look to add S6 50m freestyle gold to the 50m butterfly title she won at Rio 2016. Heats are at 10.33am (2.33am) and the final 6.47pm (10.47am).</p><div id=\"2cfb544b-72c8-4afa-b15c-0c3cf5420588\"><div><picture itemprop=\"contentUrl\"><img alt=\"Brenden Hall kicks of proceedings in the pool.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/calibre/The-Guardian-and-The-Observer--Wed--25-Aug---calibre/feed_5/article_2/images/img3_u36.jpg\"></picture></div><p><span></span><span>Brenden Hall kicks of proceedings in the pool.</span> Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images</p></div><h2>Day two</h2><p>In the pool there is a crop of British hopefuls going in the women’s SM6 200m individual medley heats at 9.37am (1.37am) in pursuit of a place in the final at 5.31pm (9.31am). Ellie Simmonds will be seeking to defend her Rio title and Ellie Robinson could be back in the water after her opening day efforts along with the world champion, Maisie Summers-Newton, and Grace Harvey.</p><p>In the equestrianism, Sir Lee Pearson seeks a 12th gold medal, in the individual test – grade II at 3.00pm (7.00am), and Sophie Wells will hope to repeat her Rio gold, in the individual test – grade V at 7.54pm (11.54am).</p><h2>Day three</h2><p>In the men’s –59kg powerlifting at 11.00am (3.00am), Ali Jawad will be looking to lift more than three times his body weight to outdo the silver he won in Rio, where he hoisted 190kg. The United States swimmer Jessica Long goes in the women’s S8 100m backstroke heats at 9.22am (1.22am) and, with 13 Paralympic golds already, she will be a strong favourite to feature prominently in the final at 5.21pm (9.21am).</p><p>There is no Afghanistan team at these Games in Tokyo but there will be a lone Afghan athlete, Mohammad Abbas Karimi, competing for the Refugee team in the men’s S5 50m butterfly, with heats at 10.00am (2.00am) and the final at 6.25pm (10.25am).</p><div id=\"137c0075-d976-43e9-a440-e2b59326c1d8\"><div><picture itemprop=\"contentUrl\"><img alt=\"Ellie Robinson with her bronze medal after the Women’s 100m Freestyle S6 Final at Rio 2016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/calibre/The-Guardian-and-The-Observer--Wed--25-Aug---calibre/feed_5/article_2/images/img4_u20.jpg\"></picture></div><p><span></span><span>Ellie Robinson, here with her bronze medal after the Women’s 100m Freestyle S6 Final at Rio 2016, is one of ParalympicsGB’s top medal hopes in Tokyo.</span> Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</p></div><h2>Day four</h2><p>In the velodrome, Kadeena Cox, Jaco van Gass and Jody Cundy will be aiming for medals in the mixed C1-5 750m team sprint, with qualifiers from 10.45am (2.45am) and the final at 12.34pm (4.34am).</p><p>David Weir is one of many GB prospects in the athletics, appearing in the men’s T54 5,000m at 8.20pm (12.20pm). After winning six Paralympic golds, including four at London 2012, Weir surprisingly failed to win a medal at Rio 2016. His late inclusion here may yet mean a suitable end to a glorious career. In the women’s race at 10.06am (2.06am), the US’s Tatyana McFadden will attempt to defend the title she won in Rio.</p><h2>Day five</h2><p>GB’s world champion Claire Cashmore and the Rio 2016 silver-medallist Lauren Steadman will both fancy their chances in the Women’s PTS5 Triathlon at 8.31am (00.31am) but, in a very competitive field, so will Japan’s Mami Tani. Tani has been one of the faces of the games in the buildup and came second in a World Triathlon Para Series event in May behind the US’s Kelly Elmlinger, who is also racing here. One of the big – very big – home hopes of glory goes in the Men’s +100kg Judo, with heats at 12.06pm (4.06am) and the final at 7.20pm (11.20am). Masaki Kento won gold at London 2012 but this time will be seeking to make up for the disappointment of bronze at Rio 2016.</p><div id=\"f7ba1f41-c1e5-4080-ad88-a266718cdc3a\"><div><picture itemprop=\"contentUrl\"><img alt=\"Lauren Steadman goes in the Women’s PTS5 Triathlon.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/calibre/The-Guardian-and-The-Observer--Wed--25-Aug---calibre/feed_5/article_2/images/img5_u10.jpg\"></picture></div><p><span></span><span>Lauren Steadman goes in the Women’s PTS5 Triathlon.</span> Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</p></div><h2>Day six</h2><p>Jess Stretton was 16 when she won women’s compound gold in the archery at Rio in 2016.

At 1.30pm (5.30am) she will set out to prove that age really is just a number. Dame Sarah Storey and Crystal Lane-Wright go in the C5 time trail at 8.00am. Jessica-Jane Applegate, Louise Fiddes and Bethany Firth carry British hopes in the women’s SM14 200m individual medley swimming. The trio will be hoping to secure places in the final at 5.42pm (9.42am) but must first get through their heats at 9.59pm (1.59am).</p><h2>Day eight</h2><p>David Smith leads the GB hopes of Boccia medals, aiming to defend his title in the mixed BC1 individual category. The bronze medal match is at 10.40am (2.40am) and the final at 4.50pm (8.50am). Claire Taggart and Will Hipwell are among the other GB medal hopes in the individual classes.</p><p>In the athletics, Markus Rehm of Germany recently beat his own long jump world record by 14cm – his leap of 8.62m has been bettered by only 14 non-disabled athletes ever – and will be well-backed to add to his golds from London and Rio.

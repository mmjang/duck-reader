You just look at them as human beings and who they are. You forget they have a disability and it’s not until you take a step back and you talk to them … that you realise the stories they have. That’s one thing that’s incredible about the <a data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics\">Paralympics</a>.”</span></p><p>Ellie Simmonds is talking about the global sporting event with which she has become synonymous. A Paralympic star since her debut at the age of 13, when she won double gold in the pool in Beijing, by the time they came around to London four years later Simmonds was the face of the Games. After winning another two gold medals on home turf, Simmonds was confirmed – whether she liked it or not – as an icon of disabled sport as it broke through to mainstream society. Rio 2016 brought more gold, but pain too, and now, at last, comes Tokyo.</p><p>“I do think it’s right that the Games go ahead,” says Simmonds of the question that has been on everyone’s lips for the past 18 months, and one only partly answered by a successful staging of the Olympics this summer. The risks from Covid faced by disabled athletes are greater than those faced by Olympians, for one. “There’s going to be a lot of alterations, they are going to try and make it as safe as they can. But we know that [the Games] brings people together. We had it in 2012 in London with an entire country and this competition, this year, is going to bring everyone together [worldwide]. A lot of people have lost their lives, people have lost their loved ones and a bit of sport can bring passion and togetherness. It’s important [Tokyo] does happen.”</p><p>Simmonds’s advocacy for the Paralympics, and what it can achieve at its best, is unforced. It surely couldn’t be any other way, given her own personal story is so intertwined with the event she has participated in every four years for half her life. But that doesn’t mean she is willing to gloss over the challenging parts.</p><p>“I found it a lot harder as I’ve got older,” she says of dealing with the expectation of being a Paralympic icon. “Going into London I was still quite young and, yeah, I felt the pressure but it was in a different way. Now the sport’s moving forward it’s getting a lot more competitive and I’m a lot older. It’s hard to stay at the top. There’s a cheesy saying isn’t there: it’s easy to get to the top but once you’re there it’s harder to stay there, and I’m fully aware of that.</p><p>“I think there are definitely times when I feel the expectations on my shoulders and I think it’s because even before I race people expect me to get a gold medal and it’s not the case. When [athletes] do well the British public get behind them and [then] they want them to do it well again, don’t they. But it is sport at the end of the day; you go out and you compete against seven other people in the final and you never know what they’re going to do. There could be a person like me who comes in when they’re 13, unknown, and comes away with two gold medals. So it is good, but it can sometimes get to me and I do find it hard for sure. But I’ve got a great support system around me to help me.”</p><div id=\"116c11e8-4ea7-4c0f-badc-9e7366c3496e\"><div><picture itemprop=\"contentUrl\"><img alt=\"Ellie Simmonds in action at the Rio Games in 2016.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/calibre/The-Guardian-and-The-Observer--Wed--25-Aug---calibre/feed_5/article_5/images/img4_u10.jpg\"></picture></div><p><span></span><span>Ellie Simmonds in action at the Rio Games in 2016.</span> Photograph: Bob Martin For Ois/AFP/Getty Images</p></div><p>Those expectations will be just one of a particularly demanding set of challenges laid down by this pandemic Paralympics.

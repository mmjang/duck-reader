The company says it will pass the threshold in the next few days, a significant milestone for a technology that has nevertheless yet to prove its utility at scale.</p>\n<p id=\"gLdnoz\">Drone deliveries began to catch the public imagination in the early 2010s as consumer quadcopters fell in price and AI control systems became more reliable. Then, in 2013, Amazon made wild promises about making drones a standard part of its delivery empire. But so far the technology has mainly found success at a much smaller scale: delivering high-value but physically small items like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320965/drone-delivery-vaccine-ghana-zipline-cold-chain-storage\">vaccines</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11367274/zipline-drone-delivery-rwanda-medicine-blood\">blood</a> in remote locations.</p>\n<p id=\"gcvDiq\">Wing’s success, though, hints that one future for drone deliveries might lie in the suburbs. </p>\n<div><p><q>more than 50,000 Wing deliveries have been made in Logan, Australia</q></p></div>\n<p id=\"lZfpVt\">Wing currently operates in three countries: Australia, the US, and Finland. Its biggest success has been in Logan, Australia: a suburb of Brisbane where more than 50,000 of its total deliveries have been carried out. Logan is home to around 300,000 residents, and Wing’s service is accessible to just over a third of this population. Users can download the Wing app and order a <a href=\"https://wing.com/australia/logan/\">small selection of goods</a>, including coffee, groceries, sushi, cakes, pet food, and sportswear. Deliveries are generally made in under 10 minutes, and Wing’s record for a delivery is two minutes and 47 seconds from order to arrival.</p>\n  <p><span>\n    \n    <span data-original=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg\">\n      \n        <picture data-cdata=\"{&quot;asset_id&quot;:22804334,&quot;ratio&quot;:&quot;*&quot;}\" data-cid=\"site/picture_element-1629900006_7457_43206\">\n  \n\n\n  <source sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hkgY_-Qt_L51F2ZnMXmJHXbYoXs=/0x0:2048x2048/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x2048):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ELLZS9m4dh5SiyaHuz1JAzOyz0=/0x0:2048x2048/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x2048):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WarOSgx2zAN1gLz5kO_PK5lmWzI=/0x0:2048x2048/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x2048):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/msoPgiAAVfIjUdVVBCMAHVyLeM8=/0x0:2048x2048/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x2048):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jiVG_byo9_1xgL3IjUu1SnT7d4Y=/0x0:2048x2048/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x2048):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rtaLjDQhrHy3v71X53zXAwfvvxg=/0x0:2048x2048/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x2048):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjS19DNvRunDZKSsmjvSgqeP_tk=/0x0:2048x2048/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x2048):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RL0k_QVvu7BtunD85-xBF4uaHk8=/0x0:2048x2048/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x2048):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0T5YdQktAF0GepLdKVCuGOPB7pc=/0x0:2048x2048/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2048x2048):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-upload-width=\"2048\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" src=\"/calibre/The-Verge--Wed--25-Aug-2021----calibre/feed_0/article_2/images/img1_u2.jpg\">\n\n</picture>\n\n      \n    </span>\n    \n  </span>\n  \n    <span>\n      \n        <p><em>A fleet of Wing delivery drones perform autonomy tests first thing in the morning</em>. </p>\n      \n      \n        <cite>Image: Wing</cite>\n      \n    </span>\n  \n</p>\n\n<p id=\"qU8dxk\">Speaking to <em>The Verge </em>via email, Wing spokesperson Jonathan Bass said Wing’s expansion in Logan shows that the company “can build a safe, scalable service that communities will embrace.” Said Bass: “There are hundreds of cities around the world just like Logan in terms of size: New Orleans, USA; Manchester, England or Florence, Italy, just to name a few.” He noted that more than 2 billion people live in cities with populations of 500,000 or fewer, though he also added that Wing has ambitions to operate in larger cities, too. </p>\n<p id=\"qf5YmF\">Part of the reason for Wing’s success seems to be the specifics of its design.
